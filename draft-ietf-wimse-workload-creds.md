--- abstract

The WIMSE architecture defines authentication and authorization for software workloads
in a variety of runtime environments, from the most basic ones up to complex
multi-service, multi-cloud, multi-tenant deployments.

This document defines the credentials that workloads use to represent their identity. They can be used in various protocols to authenticate workloads to each other. To use these credentials, workloads must provide proof of possession of the associated private key material, which is covered in other documents. This document focuses on the credentials alone, independent of the proof-of-possession mechanism.

# Introduction

This document defines authentication and authorization in the context of interaction between two workloads.
This is the core component of the WIMSE architecture {{?I-D.ietf-wimse-arch}}.
This document focuses on the credentials that carry workload identity and bind the key material to the identity. The presentation of the proof of possession of the key material is part of other documents and out of scope for this one.

In this document, two credentials are defined:

* The Workload Identity Token (WIT) is a JWT that represents the identity of a workload and binds a public key to that identity.

* The Workload Identity Certificate (WIC) is an X.509 certificate that represents the identity of a workload and binds a public key to that identity.

The Workload Identity Token is targeted for application-level protocols. The Workload Identity Certificate is targeted for transport-level protocols. This does not preclude the use of the WIT in transport-level protocols or the WIC in application-level protocols, but these are the primary intended uses.

The various protocol bindings that use these credentials to authenticate workloads to each other are out of scope for this document. At the time of writing, three such protocols are defined:

* Transport level authentication mutual TLS using the Workload Identity Certificate.

* Application level authentication using the Workload Identity Token in conjunction with a JWT-based proof of possession, the Workload Proof Token (WPT).

* Application level authentication using the Workload Identity Token in conjunction with HTTP Message Signatures.

## Use In Other Protocols

The credentials defined in this document are designed to be used in various protocols. This document does not define the protocols themselves, but rather the credentials that can be used within them. Additional protocols MAY be defined in the future that use these credentials for workload authentication.

## Deployment Architecture and Message Flow

Independent of the transport between the workloads, we assume the following logical architecture
(numbers refer to the sequence of steps listed below):

{: #high-level-seq title="Sequence of Operations"}

The Identity Server provisions credentials to each of the workloads. At least Workload A (and possibly both) must be provisioned
with a credential before the call can proceed. Details of communication with the Identity Server are out of scope
of this document, however we do describe the credential received by the workload.

PEP is a Policy Enforcement Point, the component that allows the message to go through or blocks it. PDP is an optional
Policy Decision Point, which may be deployed in architectures where policy management is centralized. All details of
policy management and message authorization are out of scope of this document.

The high-level message flow is as follows:

1. Workload A (and similarly, Workload B) obtains a credential from the Identity Server. This happens periodically, e.g. once every 24 hours.
2. A transport connection is set up. This may already include the use of the Workload Identity Certificate with transport-level security, such as TLS.
3. Workload A prepares to call Workload B. This may include adding application-level authentication information, such as the Workload Identity Token and proof of possession. Workload B authenticates Workload A.
4. Workload B authorizes the call. This policy enforcement (Policy Enforcement Point, PEP) may include consulting with an external server (Policy Decision Point, PDP) when making this decision.
5. Workload B returns a response to Workload A, which may be an error response or a regular one.

Depending on the protocol, the workload authentication may happen during step (2) at the transport-level or at step (3) at the application-level, or both.

## Workload Identifiers and Authentication Granularity {#granular-auth}

The specific format of workload identifiers (see {{I-D.ietf-wimse-arch}}) is set by local policy for each deployment,
and this choice has several implications.

Prior to WIMSE, many use cases did not allow for fully granular authentication in containerized runtime platforms.
For instance, with mutual TLS,
there's often no clear way to map the request's external access reference
(e.g., Kubernetes Ingress path, service name, or host header)
to the SubjectAltName value in the server certificate. This means that the client could only verify
if the server certificate is valid within a trust domain, not if it's tied to a specific workload.

To enable mutual and granular authentication between workloads, two things must be in place:

- Each workload must know its own identifier.
- There needs to be an explicit mapping from the external handle used to access a workload (such as an Ingress path or service DNS name)
to its workload identifier.

Once these conditions are met, the methods described in this document can be used for the caller and callee to mutually authenticate.

Implementations MUST allow for defining this mapping between the workload's access path and the workload identifier (e.g., through
callback functions). Deployments SHOULD use these features to establish a consistent set of identifiers within their environment.

## Simultaneous use

It is possible to use different workload credential simultaneously, particularly at different layers. For instance, the Workload Identity Certificate at the transport layer and the Workload Identity Token at the application layer. In this scenario, the credentials complement each other and are not alternatives to each other, meaning all MUST be validated, not just one.

A simultaneous use is particularly relevant in environments where the transport-layer security is encrypting the network between transport-layer components and the application-layer security is authenticating the actual invocation between 2 workloads.

# Application Level Workload-to-Workload Authentication {#app-level}

As noted in the Introduction, for many deployments communication between workloads cannot use
end-to-end transport security such as TLS. For these deployment styles, this document proposes a credential that can be used at the application level.

## The Workload Identity Token {#to-wit}

The Workload Identity Token (WIT) is a JWS {{RFC7515}} signed JWT {{RFC7519}} that represents the identity of a workload.
It is issued by the Identity Server and binds a public key to the workload identity. See {{workload-identity-key-management}} for security considerations.

A WIT MUST contain the following content, except where noted:

* in the JOSE header:
    * `alg`: An identifier for a JWS asymmetric digital signature algorithm
     (registered algorithm identifiers are listed in the IANA JOSE Algorithms registry {{IANA.JOSE.ALGS}}). The value `none` MUST NOT be used.
    * `typ`: the WIT is explicitly typed, as recommended in {{Section 3.11 of RFC8725}}, using the `wit+jwt` media type.
* in the JWT claims:
    * `iss`: The issuer of the token, which is the Identity Server, represented by a URI. The `iss` claim is RECOMMENDED but optional, see {{wit-iss-note}} for more.
    * `sub`: The subject of the token, which is the identity of the workload, represented by a URI. See {{I-D.ietf-wimse-arch}} for details of the Workload Identifier. And see {{granular-auth}} for security implications of these identifiers.
    * `exp`: The expiration time of the token (as defined in {{Section 4.1.4 of RFC7519}}).
      WITs should be refreshed regularly, e.g. on the order of hours.
    * `jti`: A unique identifier for the token. This claim is OPTIONAL. The `jti` claim is frequently useful for auditing issuance of individual WITs or to revoke them, but some token generation environments do not support it.
    * `cnf`: A confirmation claim referencing the public key of the workload.
        * `jwk`: Within the cnf claim, a `jwk` key MUST be present that contains the public key of the workload as defined in {{Section 3.2 of RFC7800}}. The workload MUST prove possession of the corresponding private key when presenting the WIT to another party. As such, it MUST NOT be used as a bearer token and is not intended for use in the `Authorization` header.
            * `alg`: Within the jwk object, an `alg` field MUST be present. Allowed values are listed in the IANA "JSON Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms" registry established by {{RFC7518}}. The presented proof MUST be produced with the algorithm specified in this field. The value `none` MUST NOT be used. Algorithms used in combination with symmetric keys MUST NOT be used. Also encryption algorithms MUST NOT be used as this would require additional key distribution outside of the WIT. To promote interoperability, the `ES256` signing algorithm MUST be supported by general purpose implementations of this document.

As noted in {{I-D.ietf-wimse-arch}}, a workload identifier is a URI with a trust domain component.
The runtime environment often determines which
URI scheme is used, e.g. if SPIFFE is used to authenticate workloads, it mandates "spiffe" URIs.
However for those deployments where this is not the case, this document ({{iana-uri}})
defines the "wimse" URI scheme which can be used by any deployment that implements this protocol.

An example WIT might look like this:

~~~ jwt
{::include includes/wit.txt.out}
~~~
{: #example-wit title="An example Workload Identity Token (WIT)"}

The decoded JOSE header of the WIT from the example above is shown here:

~~~ json
{
  "alg": "ES256",
  "kid": "June 5",
  "typ": "wit+jwt"
}
~~~
{: title="Example WIT JOSE Header"}

The decoded JWT claims of the WIT from the example above are shown here:

~~~ json
{
  "cnf": {
    "jwk": {
      "alg": "EdDSA",
      "crv": "Ed25519",
      "kty": "OKP",
      "x": "1CXXvflN_LVVsIsYXsUvB03JmlGWeCHqQVuouCF92bg"
    }
  },
  "exp": 1745512510,
  "iat": 1745508910,
  "jti": "x-_1CTL2cca3CSE4cwb_l",
  "sub": "wimse://example.com/specific-workload"
}
~~~
{: title="Example WIT Claims"}

The claims indicate that the example WIT:

* is valid until Thu Apr 24 2025 16:35:10 GMT (represented as NumericDate {{Section 2 of RFC7519}} value `1745512510`).
* identifies the workload to which the token was issued as `wimse://example.com/specific-workload`.
* has a unique identifier of `x-_1CTL2cca3CSE4cwb_l`.
* binds the public key represented by the `jwk` confirmation method to the workload `wimse://example.com/specific-workload`.
* requires the proof to be produced with the `EdDSA` signature algorithm.

For elucidative purposes only, the workload's key, including the private part, is shown below in JWK {{RFC7517}} format:

~~~ jwk
{
 "kty": "OKP",
 "crv": "Ed25519",
 "x": "1CXXvflN_LVVsIsYXsUvB03JmlGWeCHqQVuouCF92bg",
 "d": "sdLX8yCYKqo_XvGBLn-ZWeKT7llYeeQpgeCaXVxb5kY"
}
~~~
{: #example-caller-jwk title="Example Workload's Key"}

The afore-exampled WIT is signed with the private key of the Identity Server.
The public key(s) of the Identity Server need to be known to all workloads in order to verify the signature of the WIT.
The Identity Server's public key from this example is shown below in JWK {{RFC7517}} format:

~~~ jwk
{
 "kty": "EC",
 "kid": "June 5",
 "crv": "P-256",
 "x": "kXqnA2Op7hgd4zRMbw0iFcc_hDxUxhojxOFVGjE2gks",
 "y": "n__VndPMR021-59UAs0b9qDTFT-EZtT6xSNs_xFskLo"
}
~~~
{: title="Example Identity Server Key"}

### The WIT HTTP Header {#wit-http-header}

A WIT is conveyed in an HTTP header field named `Workload-Identity-Token`.

ABNF {{RFC5234}} for the value of `Workload-Identity-Token` header field is provided in {{wit-header-abnf}}:

~~~ abnf
ALPHA = %x41-5A / %x61-7A ; A-Z / a-z
DIGIT = %x30-39 ; 0-9
base64url = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_")
JWT =  base64url "." base64url "." base64url
WIT =  JWT
~~~~
{: #wit-header-abnf title="Workload-Identity-Token Header Field ABNF"}

The following shows the WIT from {{example-wit}} in an example of a `Workload-Identity-Token` header field:

~~~ http-message
{::include includes/wit-header.txt.out}
~~~
{: title="An example Workload Identity Token HTTP Header Field"}

Note that per {{RFC9110}}, header field names are case insensitive;
thus, `Workload-Identity-Token`, `workload-identity-token`, `WORKLOAD-IDENTITY-TOKEN`,
etc., are all valid and equivalent header field names. However, case is significant in the header field value.

### Including Additional Claims {#add-claims}

The WIT contains JSON structures and therefore can be trivially extended by adding more claims beyond those defined in the current specification.
This, however, could result in interoperability issues, which the following rules are addressing.

* To ensure interoperability in WIMSE environments, the use of Private claim names (Sec. 4.3 of {{RFC7519}}) is NOT RECOMMENDED.
* In closed environments, deployers MAY freely add claims to the WIT. Such claims SHOULD be collision-resistant, such as `example.com/myclaim`.
* A recipient that does not understand such claims MUST ignore them, as per Sec. 4 of {{RFC7519}}.
* Outside of closed environments, new claims MUST be registered with IANA {{IANA.JWT.CLAIMS}} before they can be used.

### A note on `iss` claim and key distribution {#wit-iss-note}

It is RECOMMENDED that the WIT carries an `iss` claim. This specification itself does not make use of a potential `iss` claim but also carries the trust domain in the workload identifier (see {{I-D.ietf-wimse-arch}} for a definition
of the identifier and related rules). Implementations MAY include the `iss` claim in the form of a `https` URL to facilitate key distribution via mechanisms like the `jwks_uri` from {{!RFC8414}} but alternative key distribution methods may make use of the trust domain included in the workload identifier which is carried in the mandatory `sub` claim.

## Error Conditions

Errors may occur during the processing of the WIT. If the WIT validation fails for any reason,
such as an invalid signature, an expired validity time window, or a malformed data structure, an error is returned. Typically,
this will be in response to an API call, so an HTTP status code such as 400 (Bad Request) is appropriate. This response could
include more details as per {{RFC9457}}, such as an indicator that the wrong key material or algorithm was used.  The use of HTTP
status code 401 is NOT RECOMMENDED for this purpose because it requires a WWW-Authenticate with acceptable http auth mechanisms in
the error response and an associated Authorization header in the subsequent request. The use of these headers for the WIT is not compatible
with this specification.

## Coexistence with JWT Bearer Tokens {#coexist}

The WIT defines new HTTP headers. It can therefore be presented along with existing headers used for JWT bearer tokens. This
property allows for transition from mechanisms using identity tokens based on bearer JWTs to proof of possession based WITs.
A workload may implement a policy that accepts both bearer tokens and WITs during a transition period. This policy may be configurable
per-caller to allow the workload to reject bearer tokens from callers that support WITs. Once a deployment fully supports WITs, then the use of
bearer tokens for identity can be disabled through policy.  Implementations should be careful when implementing such a transition strategy,
since the decision which token to prefer is made when the caller's identity has still not been authenticated, and needs to be revalidated following the authentication step.

The WIT can also coexist with tokens used to establish security context, such as transaction tokens {{?I-D.ietf-oauth-transaction-tokens}}. In this case a workload's
authorization policy may take into account both the sending workload's identity and the information in the context token. For example, the
identity in the WIT may be used to establish which API calls can be made and information in the context token may be used to determine
which specific resources can be accessed.

# Transport Level Workload-to-Workload Authentication {#transport-level}

As noted in the introduction, for many deployments, transport-level protection of application traffic is ideal.

## The Workload Identity Certificate {#to-wic}

The Workload Identity Certificate is an X.509 certificate. The workload identity MUST be encoded in a SubjectAltName extension of type URI. There MUST be only one SubjectAltName extension of type URI in a Workload Identity Certificate. If the workload will act as a TLS server for clients that do not understand workload identities it is RECOMMENDED that the Workload Identity Certificate contain a SubjectAltName of type DNSName with the appropriate DNS names for the server. The certificate MAY contain SubjectAltName extensions of other types.

## Client Authorization Using the Workload Identity {#client-name}

The server application retrieves the workload identifier from the client certificate subjectAltName. The identifier is used in authorization, accounting and auditing.
For example, the full workload identifier may be matched against ACLs to authorize actions requested by the peer and the identifier may be included in log messages to associate actions to the client workload for audit purposes.
A deployment may specify other authorization policies based on the specific details of how the workload identifier is constructed. The path portion of the workload identifier MUST always be considered in the scope of the trust domain.
See {{granular-auth}} on additional security implications of workload identifiers.

# Implementation Status

<cref>Note to RFC Editor: please remove this section, as well as the reference to RFC 7942, before publication.</cref>
This section records the status of known implementations of the protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in {{!RFC7942}}. The description of implementations in this section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors. This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may exist.

According to RFC 7942, "this will allow reviewers and working groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.  It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as they see fit".

# Security Considerations

## Workload Identity

The Workload Identifier is scoped within an issuer and therefore any sub-components (path portion of Identifier) are only unique within a trust domain defined by the issuer. Using a Workload Identifier without taking into account the trust domain could allow one domain to issue tokens to spoof identities in another domain. Additionally, the trust domain must be tied to an authorized issuer cryptographic trust anchor through some mechanism such as a JWKS or X.509 certificate chain. The association of an issuer, trust domain and a cryptographic trust anchor MUST be communicated securely out of band.

## Workload Identity Token and Proof of Possession

The Workload Identity Token (WIT) is bound to a secret cryptographic key and is always presented with a proof of possession as described in {{to-wit}}. The WIT is a general purpose token that can be presented in multiple contexts. The WIT and its PoP are only used in the application-level options, and both are not used in MTLS. The WIT MUST NOT be used as a bearer token. While this helps reduce the sensitivity of the token it is still possible that a token and its proof of possession may be captured and replayed within the PoP's lifetime. The following are some mitigations for the capture and reuse of the proof of possession (PoP):

* Preventing Eavesdropping and Interception with TLS

An attacker observing or intercepting the communication channel can view the token and its proof of possession and attempt to replay it to gain an advantage. In order to prevent this the
token and proof of possession MUST be sent over a secure, server authenticated TLS connection unless a secure channel is provided by some other mechanisms.

* Limiting Proof of Possession Lifespan

The proof of possession MUST be time limited. A PoP should only be valid over the time necessary for it to be successfully used for the purpose it is needed. This will typically be on the order of minutes.  PoPs received outside their validity time MUST be rejected.

* Limiting Proof of Possession Scope

In order to reduce the risk of theft and replay the PoP should have a limited scope. For example, a PoP may be targeted for use with a specific workload and even a specific transaction to reduce the impact of a stolen PoP. In some cases a workload may wish to reuse a PoP for a period of time or have it accepted by multiple target workloads. A careful analysis is warranted to understand the impacts to the system if a PoP is disclosed allowing it to be presented by an attacker along with a captured WIT.

* Replay Protection

Proof of possession mechanisms should include replay protection to prevent reuse of a captured PoP. Without it an attacker can replay a captured PoP within its validity period.

* Binding to TLS Endpoint

The POP MAY be bound to a transport layer sender such as the client identity of a TLS session or TLS channel binding parameters. The mechanisms for binding are outside the scope of this specification.

## Workload Identity Key Management

Both the Workload Identity Token and the Workload Identity Certificate carry a public key. The corresponding private key:

* MUST be kept private
* MUST be individual for each Workload Identifier (see {{I-D.ietf-wimse-arch}})
* MUST NOT be used once the credential is expired
* SHOULD be re-generated for each new Workload Identity Token or Certificate.

## Middle Boxes {#middleboxes}

In some deployments the Workload Identity Token and proof of possession may pass through multiple systems. The communication between the systems is over TLS, but the token and PoP are available in the clear at each intermediary.  While the intermediary cannot modify the token or the information within the PoP they can attempt to capture and replay the token or modify the data not protected by the PoP.

Mitigations listed in {{app-level}} can be used to provide some protection from middle boxes.

Deployments should perform analysis on their situation to determine if it is appropriate to trust and allow traffic to pass through a middle box.

## Privacy Considerations

WITs and the proofs of possession may contain private information such as user names or other identities. Care should be taken to prevent the disclosure of this information. The use of TLS helps protect the privacy of WITs and proofs of possession.

WITs and certificates with workload identifiers are typically associated with a workload and not a specific user, however in some deployments the workload may be associated directly to a user. While these are exceptional cases a deployment should evaluate if the disclosure of WITs or certificates can be used to track a user.

* Add registration request content for a `wimse` URI scheme.
* New section on key management.
* Use of the `Accept-Signature` header.

## draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol-06

* Explicit definition of the Workload Identity Certificate.
* Definition of the validation of workload identifiers as part of workload authentication. Still work in progress.

## draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol-05

* Removed the entire Workload Identity section which is now covered in the Architecture document.
* Content-Digest is mandatory with HTTP-Sig.
* Some wording on extending the protocol beyond HTTP.
* IANA considerations.

## draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol-04

* Require `cnf.jwk.alg` in WIT which restricts signature algorithm of WPT or HTTP-Sig.
* Replay protection as a SHOULD for both WPT and HTTP-Sig.
* Consolidate terminology with the Architecture draft.

## draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol-03

* Consistently use "workload".
* Implement comments from the SPIFFE community.
* Make `iss` claim in WIT optional and add wording about its relation to key distribution.

* Make `jti` claim in WIT optional.
* Error handling for the application level methods.

## draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol-02

* Coexistence with bearer tokens.
* Improve the architecture diagram.
* Some more ABNF.
* Clarified identifiers and URIs.
* Moved an author to acknowledgments.

## draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol-01

* Addressed multiple comments from Pieter.
* Clarified WIMSE identity concepts, specifically "trust domain"
and "workload identifier".
* Much more detail around mTLS, including some normative language.
* WIT (the identity token) is now included in the WPT proof of possession.
* Added a section comparing the DPoP-inspired app-level security option to
the Message Signature-based alternative.

## draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol-00
