                       WIMSE Workload Proof Token
                      draft-ietf-wimse-wpt-latest

Abstract

   The WIMSE architecture defines authentication and authorization for
   software workloads in a variety of runtime environments, from basic
   deployments to complex multi-service, multi-cloud, multi-tenant
   systems.  This document specifies the Workload Proof Token (WPT), a
   mechanism for workloads to prove possession of the private key
   associated with a Workload Identity Token (WIT).  The WPT is a signed
   JWT that binds the workload's authentication to a specific HTTP
   request, providing application-level proof of possession for
   workload-to-workload communication.  This specification is designed
   to work alongside the WIT credential format defined in draft-ietf-
   wimse-workload-creds and can be combined with other WIMSE protocols
   in multi-hop call chains.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines the Workload Proof Token (WPT), a simple,
   protocol-independent mechanism for proving possession of the private
   key associated with a Workload Identity Token (WIT).  The WIT,
   defined in [I-D.ietf-wimse-workload-creds], is a credential that
   binds a public key to a workload identity and is designed to require
   proof of possession - it must not be used as a bearer token.  The WPT
   provides that proof of possession.  The WPT's primary design goal is
   simplicity: it is a signed JWT that demonstrates control of the
   private key corresponding to the public key in the WIT.  By requiring
   this cryptographic proof, the WPT significantly reduces the risk of
   credential theft and replay attacks compared to bearer token
   approaches.  The WPT is protocol-agnostic by design.  While this
   specification provides detailed guidance for HTTP-based usage
   (including the Workload-Proof-Token HTTP header field), the core WPT
   format is fundamentally a signed JWT that can be adapted to other
   protocols including asynchronous messaging systems, event-driven
   architectures, and future transport mechanisms.  The JWT-based
   structure allows for protocol-specific extensions through additional
   claims while maintaining core interoperability.

   Key characteristics of the WPT include:

   Proof of Possession: Demonstrates control of the WIT's associated
   private key through a digital signature.  Context Binding: Binds the
   proof to specific message context through claims such as audience
   (aud) and WIT hash (wth).  Other tokens in the message can also be
   bound (e.g., OAuth access tokens, transaction tokens) to provide
   unified proof across different authorization contexts.  Short-Lived:
   Typically valid for minutes or seconds, limiting replay attack
   windows.  Protocol Independent: Core format is not tied to any
   specific transport protocol.

   This specification is part of the WIMSE protocol suite, which
   includes credential formats defined in
   [I-D.ietf-wimse-workload-creds] and follows the architectural
   principles in [I-D.ietf-wimse-arch].  The WPT provides application-
   level proof of possession particularly suited for environments where
   transport-level solutions are insufficient or where communication
   patterns span multiple protocols.  This document defines the WPT JWT
   format, its HTTP usage, validation requirements, and security
   considerations.  Out of scope are the WIT credential format itself
   (covered in [I-D.ietf-wimse-workload-creds]), policy enforcement and
   authorization, credential issuance and lifecycle management, detailed
   bindings for non-HTTP protocols (to be addressed in future
   specifications), and alternative proof-of-possession mechanisms such
   as HTTP Message Signatures.

2.  Workload Proof Token

   The Workload Proof Token (WPT) is a JWT that provides proof of
   possession of the private key associated with a Workload Identity
   Token (WIT).  The Workload Identity Token is sent in the request as
   described in [I-D.ietf-wimse-workload-creds].  The WPT, is sent in
   the Workload-Proof-Token header field of the request.  The ABNF
   syntax of the Workload-Proof-Token header field is:

   WPT =  JWT

              Figure 1: Workload-Proof-Token Header Field ABNF

   where the JWT projection is defined in Figure 1.

   A WPT MUST contain the following:

   *  in the JOSE header:

      -  alg: An identifier for an appropriate JWS asymmetric digital
         signature algorithm corresponding to the confirmation key in
         the associated WIT.  The value MUST match the alg value of the
         jwk in the cnf claim of the WIT.  See
         [I-D.ietf-wimse-workload-creds] for valid values and
         restrictions.

      -  typ: the WPT is explicitly typed, as recommended in
         Section 3.11 of [RFC8725], using the application/wpt+jwt media
         type.

   *  in the JWT claims:

      -  aud: The audience SHOULD contain the HTTP target URI
         (Section 7.1 of [RFC9110]) of the request to which the WPT is
         attached, without query or fragment parts.  However, there may
         be some normalization, rewriting or other process that requires
         the audience to be set to a deployment-specific value.

      -  exp: The expiration time of the WPT (as defined in
         Section 4.1.4 of [RFC7519]).  WPT lifetimes MUST be short,
         e.g., on the order of minutes or seconds.

      -  jti: An identifier for the token.  The value MUST be unique, at
         least within the scope of the sender.

      -  wth: Hash of the Workload Identity Token, defined in
         [I-D.ietf-wimse-workload-creds].  The value is the base64url
         encoding of the SHA-256 hash of the ASCII encoding of the WIT's
         value.

      -  ath: Hash of the OAuth access token, if present in the request,
         which might convey end-user identity and/or authorization
         context of the request.  The value, as per Section 4.1 of
         [RFC9449], is the base64url encoding of the SHA-256 hash of the
         ASCII encoding of the access token's value.

      -  tth: Hash of the Txn-Token [I-D.ietf-oauth-transaction-tokens],
         if present in the request, which might convey end-user identity
         and/or authorization context of the request.  The value MUST be
         the result of a base64url encoding (as defined in Section 2 of
         [RFC7515]) of the SHA-256 hash of the ASCII encoding of the
         associated token's value.

      -  oth: Hash(es) of other token(s) in the request that convey end-
         user identity and/or authorization context of the request.  The
         value is a JSON object with a key-value pair for each such
         token.  For each, in the absence of an application profile
         specifying details, the key corresponds to the header field
         name containing the token, and the value is the base64url
         encoding of the SHA-256 hash of the ASCII bytes of the header
         field value with any leading or trailing spaces removed.  The
         header field name MUST be normalized by converting it to all
         lower case.  Header fields occurring multiple times in the
         request are not supported by default.  An application profile
         may specify different behavior for a key, such as using a
         different hash algorithm or means of locating the token in the
         request.

   To clarify: the ath, tth and oth claims are each mandatory if the
   respective tokens are included in the request.

   The rules for using non-standard claims in WPTs are documented in
   Section 2.3.

   An example WPT might look like the following:

              Figure 5: Example HTTP Request with WIT and WPT

   To validate the WPT in the request, the recipient MUST ensure the
   following:

   *  There is exactly one Workload-Proof-Token header field in the
      request.

   *  The Workload-Proof-Token header field value is a single and well-
      formed JWT.

   *  The signature algorithm in the alg JOSE header string-equal
      matches the alg attribute of the jwk in the cnf claim of the WIT.

   *  The WPT signature is valid using the public key from the
      confirmation claim of the WIT.

   *  The typ JOSE header parameter of the WPT conveys a media type of
      wpt+jwt.

   *  The aud claim of the WPT matches the target URI, or an acceptable
      alias or normalization thereof, of the HTTP request in which the
      WPT was received, ignoring any query and fragment parts.

   *  The exp claim is present and conveys a time that has not passed.
      WPTs with an expiration time unreasonably far in the future SHOULD
      be rejected.

   *  The wth claim is present and matches the hash of the token value
      conveyed in the Workload-Identity-Token header.

   *  It is RECOMMENDED to check that the value of the jti claim has not
      been used before in the time window in which the respective WPT
      would be considered valid.

   *  If presented in conjunction with an OAuth access token, the value
      of the ath claim matches the hash of that token's value.

   *  If presented in conjunction with a Txn-Token, the value of the tth
      claim matches the hash of that token's value.

   *  If presented in conjunction with a token conveying end-user
      identity or authorization context, the value of the oth claim
      matches the hash of that token's value.

   *  If the oth claim is present, verify the hashes of all tokens
      listed in the oth claim per the default behavior defined in
      Section 2 or as specified by an application specific profile.  If
      the oth claim contains entries that are not understood by the
      recipient, the WPT MUST be rejected.  Conversely, additional
      tokens not covered by the oth claim MUST NOT be used by the
      recipient to make authorization decisions.

2.1.  Error Conditions

   Errors may occur during the processing of the WPT.  If the signature
   verification fails for any reason, such as an invalid signature, an
   expired validity time window, or a malformed data structure, an error
   is returned.  Typically, this will be in response to an API call, so
   an HTTP status code such as 400 (Bad Request) is appropriate.  This
   response could include more details as per [RFC9457], such as an
   indicator that the wrong key material or algorithm was used.  The use
   of HTTP status code 401 is NOT RECOMMENDED for this purpose because
   it requires a WWW-Authenticate with acceptable http auth mechanisms
   in the error response and an associated Authorization header in the
   subsequent request.  The use of these headers for the WIT or WPT is
   not compatible with this specification.

2.2.  Coexistence with JWT Bearer Tokens

   The WIT and WPT define new HTTP headers.  They can therefore be
   presented along with existing headers used for JWT bearer tokens.
   This property allows for transition from mechanisms using identity
   tokens based on bearer JWTs to proof of possession based WITs.  A
   workload may implement a policy that accepts both bearer tokens and
   WITs during a transition period.  This policy may be configurable
   per-caller to allow the workload to reject bearer tokens from callers
   that support WITs.  Once a deployment fully supports WITs, then the
   use of bearer tokens for identity can be disabled through policy.
   Implementations should be careful when implementing such a transition
   strategy, since the decision which token to prefer is made when the
   caller's identity has still not been authenticated, and needs to be
   revalidated following the authentication step.

   The WIT can also coexist with tokens used to establish security
   context, such as transaction tokens
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-transaction-tokens].  In this case a workload's
   authorization policy may take into account both the sending
   workload's identity and the information in the context token.  For
   example, the identity in the WIT may be used to establish which API
   calls can be made and information in the context token may be used to
   determine which specific resources can be accessed.

2.3.  Including Additional Claims

   The WPT contains JSON structures and therefore can be trivially
   extended by adding more claims beyond those defined in the current
   specification.  This, however, could result in interoperability
   issues, which the following rules are addressing.

   *  To ensure interoperability in WIMSE environments, the use of
      Private claim names (Sec. 4.3 of [RFC7519]) is NOT RECOMMENDED.

   *  In closed environments, deployers MAY freely add claims to the
      WPT.  Such claims SHOULD be collision-resistant, such as
      example.com/myclaim.

   *  A recipient that does not understand such claims MUST ignore them,
      as per Sec. 4 of [RFC7519].

   *  Outside of closed environments, new claims MUST be registered with
      IANA [IANA.JWT.CLAIMS] before they can be used.

3.  Security Considerations

3.1.  Workload Identity Token and Proof of Possession

   The Workload Identity Token (WIT) is bound to a secret cryptographic
   key and is always presented with a proof of possession as described
   in [I-D.ietf-wimse-workload-creds].  The WIT is a general purpose
   token that can be presented in multiple contexts.  The WIT and WPT
   are only used in the application-level options, and both are not used
   in MTLS.  The WIT MUST NOT be used as a bearer token.  While this
   helps reduce the sensitivity of the token it is still possible that a
   token and its proof of possession may be captured and replayed within
   the PoP's lifetime.  The following are some mitigations for the
   capture and reuse of the proof of possession (PoP):

   *  Preventing Eavesdropping and Interception with TLS

   An attacker observing or intercepting the communication channel can
   view the token and its proof of possession and attempt to replay it
   to gain an advantage.  In order to prevent this the token and proof
   of possession MUST be sent over a secure, server authenticated TLS
   connection unless a secure channel is provided by some other
   mechanisms.  Host name validation MUST be performed by the client.

   *  Limiting Proof of Possession Lifespan

   The proof of possession MUST be time limited.  A PoP should only be
   valid over the time necessary for it to be successfully used for the
   purpose it is needed.  This will typically be on the order of
   minutes.  PoPs received outside their validity time MUST be rejected.

   *  Limiting Proof of Possession Scope

   In order to reduce the risk of theft and replay the PoP should have a
   limited scope.  For example, a PoP may be targeted for use with a
   specific workload and even a specific transaction to reduce the
   impact of a stolen PoP.  In some cases a workload may wish to reuse a
   PoP for a period of time or have it accepted by multiple target
   workloads.  A careful analysis is warranted to understand the impacts
   to the system if a PoP is disclosed allowing it to be presented by an
   attacker along with a captured WIT.

   *  Replay Protection

   A proof of possession includes the jti claim that MUST uniquely
   identify it, within the scope of a particular sender.  This claim
   SHOULD be used by the receiver to perform basic replay protection
   against tokens it has already seen.  Depending upon the design of the
   system it may be difficult to synchronize the replay cache across all
   token validators.  If an attacker can somehow influence the identity
   of the validator (e.g. which cluster member receives the message)
   then replay protection would not be effective.

   *  Binding to TLS Endpoint

   The POP MAY be bound to a transport layer sender such as the client
   identity of a TLS session or TLS channel binding parameters.  The
   mechanisms for binding are outside the scope of this specification.

3.2.  Workload Identity Key Management

   The Workload Identity Token is signed by a private key in possession
   of the workload.  This private key:

   *  MUST be kept private

   *  MUST be individual for each Workload Identifier (see
      [I-D.ietf-wimse-arch])

   *  MUST NOT be used once the Workload Identity Token is expired

   *  SHOULD be individual for each Workload Identity Token issued

   *  SHOULD not be reused for other purposes

3.3.  Middle Boxes

   In some deployments the Workload Identity Token and Workload Proof
   Token may pass through multiple systems.  The communication between
   the systems is over TLS, but the WIT and WPT are available in the
   clear at each intermediary.  While the intermediary cannot modify the
   token or the information within the PoP they can attempt to capture
   and replay the token or modify the data not protected by the PoP.

   It is important to note that the WPT does not protect major portions
   of the request and response and therefore does not provide protection
   from an actively malicious middle box.  Deployments should perform
   analysis on their situation to determine if it is appropriate to
   trust and allow traffic to pass through a middle box.

3.4.  Privacy Considerations

   The Workload Proof Token may contain private information such as user
   names or other identities.  Care should be taken to prevent the
   disclosure of this information.  The use of TLS helps protect the
   privacy of WITs and proofs of possession.

   The workload identifier present in the WPT is typically associated
   with a workload and not a specific user, however in some deployments
   the workload or the HTTP Target URI may be associated directly to a
   user.  While these are exceptional cases a deployment should evaluate
   if the disclosure of a WPT can be used to track a user.

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  JSON Web Token Claims

   IANA is requested to add the following entries to the "JSON Web Token
   Claims" registry [IANA.JWT.CLAIMS]:

    +============+===================+===================+===========+
    | Claim Name | Claim Description | Change Controller | Reference |
    +============+===================+===================+===========+

   *  Removed the entire Workload Identity section which is now covered
      in the Architecture document.

   *  Content-Digest is mandatory with HTTP-Sig.

   *  Some wording on extending the protocol beyond HTTP.

   *  IANA considerations.

A.5.  draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol-04

   *  Require cnf.jwk.alg in WIT which restricts signature algorithm of
      WPT or HTTP-Sig.

   *  Replay protection as a SHOULD for both WPT and HTTP-Sig.

   *  Consolidate terminology with the Architecture draft.

A.6.  draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol-03

   *  Consistently use "workload".

   *  Implement comments from the SPIFFE community.

   *  Make iss claim in WIT optional and add wording about its relation
      to key distribution.

   *  Remove iss claim from WPT.

   *  Make jti claim in WIT optional.

   *  Error handling for the application level methods.

A.7.  draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol-02

   *  Coexistence with bearer tokens.

   *  Improve the architecture diagram.

   *  Some more ABNF.

   *  Clarified identifiers and URIs.

   *  Moved an author to acknowledgments.

A.8.  draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol-01

   *  Addressed multiple comments from Pieter.

   *  Clarified WIMSE identity concepts, specifically "trust domain" and
      "workload identifier".

   *  Much more detail around mTLS, including some normative language.

   *  WIT (the identity token) is now included in the WPT proof of
      possession.

   *  Added a section comparing the DPoP-inspired app-level security
      option to the Message Signature-based alternative.

A.9.  draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol-00

   *  Initial WG draft, an exact copy of draft-sheffer-wimse-s2s-
      protocol-00

   *  Added this document history section
