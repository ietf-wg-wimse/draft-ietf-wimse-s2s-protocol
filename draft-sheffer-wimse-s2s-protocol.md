# Introduction

This document defines authentication and authorization in the context of interaction between two workloads.
This is the core component of the WIMSE architecture {{?I-D.ietf-wimse-arch}}.
Assume that Service A needs to call Service B. For simplicity, this document focuses on HTTP-based services,
and the service-to-service call consists of a single HTTP request and its response.
We define the credentials that both services should possess and how they are used to protect the HTTP exchange.

There are multiple deployment styles in use today, and they result in different security properties.
We propose to address them differently.

* Many use cases have various middleboxes inserted between pairs of services, resulting in a transport layer
that is not end-to-end encrypted. We propose to address these use cases by protecting the HTTP messages at the application
level ({{app-level}}).

* The other commonly deployed architecture has a mutual-TLS connection between each pair of services. This setup
can be addressed by a simpler solution ({{mutual-tls}}).

It is an explicit goal of this protocol that a service deployment can include both architectures across a multi-chain call.
In other words, Service A can call Service B with mutual TLS protection,
while the next call to Service C is protected at the application level.

For application-level protection we currently propose two alternative solutions, one inspired by DPoP {{?RFC9449}} in {{dpop-esque-auth}} and
one which is a profile of HTTP Message Signatures {{!RFC9421}} in {{http-sig-auth}}. The design team believes that we need to pick
one of these two alternatives for standardization, once we have understood their pros and cons.

## Deployment Architecture and Message Flow

Regardless of the transport between the workloads, we assume the following logical architecture:

~~~ aasvg
+------------+               +------------+
|            |               |            |
|            |               | Workload B |
| Workload A |==============>|            |
|            |               |   +--------+
|            |               |   |  PEP   |
+------------+               +---+--------+
      ^                        ^     ^

      | +----------------------+     |
      | |                            |
      v v                            v
+------------+               +------------+
|            |               |            |
|  Identity  |               |    PDP     |
|   Server   |               | (optional) |
|            |               |            |
+------------+               +------------+
~~~

The Identity Server provisions credentials to each of the workloads. At least Workload A (and possibly both) must be provisioned
with a credential before the call can proceed. Details of communication with the Identity Server are out of scope
of this document, however we do describe the credential received by the workload.

PEP is a Policy Enforcement Point, the component that allows the call to go through or blocks it. PDP is an optional
Policy Decision Point, which may be deployed in architectures where policy management is centralized. All details of
policy management and message authorization are out of scope of this document.

The high-level message flow is as follows:

* Workload A obtains a credential from the Identity Server. This happens periodically, e.g. once every 24 hours.
* Workload A makes an HTTP call into Workload B. This is a regular HTTP request, with the additional protection
mechanisms defined below.
* Workload B now authenticates Workload A and decides whether to authorize the call.
In certain architectures, Workload B may need to consult with an external server to decide whether to accept the call.
* Workload B returns a response to Workload A, which may be an error response or a regular one.

# Conventions and Definitions

This document uses "service" and "workload" interchangeably. Otherwise, all terms are as defined by {{?I-D.ietf-wimse-arch}}.

# Application Level Service To Service Authentication {#app-level}

## The Workload Identity Token {#to-wit}

The Workload Identity Token (WIT) is a JWS {{RFC7515}} signed JWT {{RFC7519}} that represents the identity of a workload.
It is issued by the Identity Server and binds a public key to the workload identity.
A WIT MUST contain the following:

* in the JOSE header:
    * `alg`: An identifier for a JWS asymmetric digital signature algorithm
     (registered algorithm identifiers are listed in the IANA JOSE Algorithms registry {{IANA.JOSE.ALGS}}). The value `none` MUST NOT be used.
    * `typ`: the WIT is explicitly typed, as recommended in {{Section 3.11 of RFC8725}}, using the `wimse-id+jwt` media type.
* in the JWT claims:
    * `iss`: The issuer of the token, which is the Identity Server, represented by a URI.
    * `sub`: The subject of the token, which is the identity of the workload, represented by a URI.
    * `exp`: The expiration time of the token (as defined in {{Section 4.1.4 of RFC7519}}).
      WITs should be refreshed regularly, e.g. on the order of hours.
    * `jti`: A unique identifier for the token.
    * `cnf`: A confirmation claim containing the public key of the workload using the `jwk` member as defined in {{Section 3.2 of RFC7800}}.
     The WIT MUST NOT be used as a bearer token. Instead, it should be used in conjunction with one of the methods in {{dpop-esque-auth}} or {{http-sig-auth}}.

An example WIT might look like this (all examples, of course, are non-normative and with line breaks and extra space for readability):

~~~ jwt

{: #example-wit title="An example Workload Identity Token (WIT)"}

The decoded JOSE header of the WIT from the example above is shown here:

~~~ json
{
 "typ": "wimse-id+jwt",
 "alg": "ES256",
 "kid": "June 5"
}
~~~
{: title="Example WIT JOSE Header"}

The decoded JWT claims of the WIT from the example above are shown here:

~~~ json
{
 "iss": "wimse://example.com/trusted-central-authority",
 "exp": 1717612470,
 "sub": "wimse://example.com/specific-workload",
 "jti": "x-_1CTL2cca3CSE4cwb__",
 "cnf": {
  "jwk": {
   "kty": "OKP",
   "crv": "Ed25519",
   "x": "_amRC3YrYbHhH1RtYrL8cSmTDMhYtOUTG78cGTR5ezk"
  }
 }
}
~~~
{: title="Example WIT Claims"}

The claims indicate that the example WIT:

* was issued by an Identity Server known as `wimse://example.com/trusted-central-authority`.
* is valid until May 15, 2024 3:28:45 PM GMT-06:00 (represented as NumericDate {{Section 2 of RFC7519}} value `1717612470`).
* identifies the workload to which the token was issued as `wimse://example.com/specific-workload`.
* has a unique identifier of `x-_1CTL2cca3CSE4cwb__`.
* binds the public key represented by the `jwk` confirmation method to the workload `wimse://example.com/specific-workload`.

For elucidative purposes only, the workload's key, including the private part, is shown below in JWK {{RFC7517}} format:

~~~ jwk
{
 "kty":"OKP",
 "crv":"Ed25519",
 "x":"_amRC3YrYbHhH1RtYrL8cSmTDMhYtOUTG78cGTR5ezk",
 "d":"G4lGAYFtFq5rwyjlgSIRznIoCF7MtKDHByyUUZCqLiA"
}
~~~
{: title="Example Workload's Key"}

The afore-exampled WIT is signed with the private key of the Identity Server.
The public key(s) of the Identity Server need to be known to all workloads in order to verify the signature of the WIT.
The Identity Server's public key from this example is shown below in JWK {{RFC7517}} format:

~~~ jwk
{
 "kty":"EC",
 "kid":"June 5",
 "x":"kXqnA2Op7hgd4zRMbw0iFcc_hDxUxhojxOFVGjE2gks",
 "y":"n__VndPMR021-59UAs0b9qDTFT-EZtT6xSNs_xFskLo",
 "crv":"P-256"
}
~~~
{: title="Example Identity Server Key"}

### The WIT HTTP Header {#wit-http-header}

A WIT is conveyed in an HTTP header field named `Workload-Identity-Token`.

For those who celebrate, ABNF {{RFC5234}} for the value of `Workload-Identity-Token` header field is provided in {{wit-header-abnf}}:

~~~ abnf
ALPHA = %x41-5A / %x61-7A ; A-Z / a-z
DIGIT = %x30-39 ; 0-9
base64url = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_")
WIT =  base64url "." base64url "." base64url
~~~~
{: #wit-header-abnf title="Workload-Identity-Token Header Field ABNF"}

The following shows the WIT from the {{example-wit}} in an example of a `Workload-Identity-Token` header field:

~~~ http-message

Note that per {{RFC9110}}, header field names are case insensitive;
thus, `Workload-Identity-Token`, `workload-identity-token`, `WORKLOAD-IDENTITY-TOKEN`,
etc., are all valid and equivalent header field names. However, case is significant in the header field value.
