1.  Introduction

   This document defines authentication and authorization in the context
   of interaction between two workloads.  This is the core component of
   the WIMSE architecture [I-D.ietf-wimse-arch].  Assume that Service A
   needs to call Service B.  For simplicity, this document focuses on
   HTTP-based services, and the service-to-service call consists of a
   single HTTP request and its response.  We define the credentials that
   both services should possess and how they are used to protect the
   HTTP exchange.

   There are multiple deployment styles in use today, and they result in
   different security properties.  We propose to address them
   differently.

   *  Many use cases have various middleboxes inserted between pairs of
      services, resulting in a transport layer that is not end-to-end
      encrypted.  We propose to address these use cases by protecting
      the HTTP messages at the application level (Section 3).

   *  The other commonly deployed architecture has a mutual-TLS
      connection between each pair of services.  This setup can be
      addressed by a simpler solution (Section 4).

   It is an explicit goal of this protocol that a service deployment can
   include both architectures across a multi-chain call.  In other
   words, Service A can call Service B with mutual TLS protection, while
   the next call to Service C is protected at the application level.

   For application-level protection we currently propose two alternative
   solutions, one inspired by DPoP [RFC9449] and one which is a profile
   of HTTP Message Signatures [RFC9421].  The design team believes that
   we need to pick one of these two alternatives for standardization,
   once we have understood their pros and cons.

1.1.  Deployment Architecture and Message Flow

   Regardless of the transport between the workloads, we assume the
   following logical architecture:

   +------------+               +------------+
   |            |               |            |
   |            |               | Workload B |
   | Workload A |==============>|            |
   |            |               |   +--------+
   |            |               |   |  PEP   |
   +------------+               +---+--------+
         ^                        ^     ^
         |                        |     |
         | +----------------------+     |
         | |                            |
         v v                            v
   +------------+               +------------+
   |            |               |            |
   |  Identity  |               |    PDP     |
   |   Server   |               | (optional) |
   |            |               |            |
   +------------+               +------------+

   The Identity Server provisions credentials to each of the workloads.
   At least Workload A (and possibly both) must be provisioned with a
   credential before the call can proceed.  Details of communication
   with the Identity Server are out of scope of this document, however
   we do describe the credential received by the workload.

   PEP is a Policy Enforcement Point, the component that allows the call
   to go through or blocks it.  PDP is an optional Policy Decision
   Point, which may be deployed in architectures where policy management
   is centralized.  All details of policy management and message
   authorization are out of scope of this document.

   The high-level message flow is as follows:

   *  Workload A obtains a credential from the Identity Server.  This
      happens periodically, e.g. once every 24 hours.

   *  Workload A makes an HTTP call into Workload B.  This is a regular
      HTTP request, with the additional protection mechanisms defined
      below.

   *  Workload B now authenticates Workload A and decides whether to
      authorize the call.  In certain architectures, Workload B may need
      to consult with an external server to decide whether to accept the
      call.

   *  Workload B returns a response to Workload A, which may be an error
      response or a regular one.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   This document uses "service" and "workload" interchangeably.
   Otherwise, all terms are as defined by [I-D.ietf-wimse-arch].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Application Level Service To Service Authentication

3.1.  The WIMSE ID Token

3.2.  Option 1: DPoP-Inspired Authentication

3.3.  Option 2: Authentication Based on HTTP Message Signatures

4.  Using Mutual TLS for Service To Service Authentication

   The WIMSE workload identity may be carried within an X.509
   certificate.  When the WIMSE workload identity is present in a
   certificate it MUST be encoded in a SubjctAltName extension of type
   URI.  There MUST be only one SubjectAltName extension of type URI in
   a WIMSE certificate.  The WIMSE certificate may contain
   SubjectAltName extensions of other types such as DNSName.

   WIMSE identities may be used to validate server and client
   connections.  When validating a WIMSE identity the relying party must
   validate that this CA issuer for the WIMSE identity is authorized to
   issue certificates for the trust domain of the WIMSE identity in the
   certificate.  Other PKIX path validation rules apply.

4.1.  Host Name Validation

   [TODO: the following paragraph needs better alignment with RFC 9525.
   The following is a very drafty straw man]

   WIMSE clients MUST validate that the trust domain portion of the
   WIMSE certificate matches the expected trust domain for the server
   side of the connection.  It is also RECOMMENDED that the client match
   the WIMSE identity in the certificate against the WIMSE identity of
   the workload of the intended server.  In this case the trust domain
   portion of the URI is NOT treated as a host name as specified section
   6.4 of [RFC9525] but rather as a trust domain, the server identity is
   encoded in the path portion of the WIMSE identity in a deployment
   specific way.

   In some cases the WIMSE client may connect to the server using a DNS
   host name in which case the client MUST perform host name validation
   as defined in 6.3 in RFC 9525.

4.2.  Client Authentication Using the WIMSE Identity

   Servers wishing to use the WIMSE identity for authorizing the client
   MUST require client certificate authentication in the TLS handshake.
   Other methods of post handshake authentication are not specified by
   this document.  WIMSE servers MUST validate that the trust domain
   portion of the WIMSE certificate matches the expected trust domain
   for the client side of the connection.  The server may also may the
   WIMSE identity available to the application to use the full URI to
   match against ACLs and other policy constructs for authorization or
   use the WIMSE ID for accounting and auditing.

   WIMSE clients may also use the full WIMSE URI to authorize the server
   against various policies and for accounting and auditing purposes.

5.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security and Privacy

   TLS trust assumptions, server vs mutual auth, middleboxes

6.  IANA Considerations
