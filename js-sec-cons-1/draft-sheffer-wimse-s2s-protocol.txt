1.  Introduction

   This document defines authentication and authorization in the context
   of interaction between two workloads.  This is the core component of
   the WIMSE architecture [I-D.ietf-wimse-arch].  Assume that Service A
   needs to call Service B.  For simplicity, this document focuses on
   HTTP-based services, and the service-to-service call consists of a
   single HTTP request and its response.  We define the credentials that
   both services should possess and how they are used to protect the
   HTTP exchange.

   There are multiple deployment styles in use today, and they result in
   different security properties.  We propose to address them
   differently.

   *  Many use cases have various middleboxes inserted between pairs of
      services, resulting in a transport layer that is not end-to-end
      encrypted.  We propose to address these use cases by protecting
      the HTTP messages at the application level (Section 3).

   *  The other commonly deployed architecture has a mutual-TLS
      connection between each pair of services.  This setup can be
      addressed by a simpler solution (Section 4).

   It is an explicit goal of this protocol that a service deployment can
   include both architectures across a multi-chain call.  In other
   words, Service A can call Service B with mutual TLS protection, while
   the next call to Service C is protected at the application level.

   For application-level protection we currently propose two alternative
   solutions, one inspired by DPoP [RFC9449] and one which is a profile
   of HTTP Message Signatures [RFC9421].  The design team believes that
   we need to pick one of these two alternatives for standardization,
   once we have understood their pros and cons.

1.1.  Deployment Architecture and Message Flow

   Regardless of the transport between the workloads, we assume the
   following logical architecture:

   +------------+               +------------+
   |            |               |            |
   |            |               | Workload B |
   | Workload A |==============>|            |
   |            |               |   +--------+
   |            |               |   |  PEP   |
   +------------+               +---+--------+
         ^                        ^     ^
         |                        |     |
         | +----------------------+     |
         | |                            |
         v v                            v
   +------------+               +------------+
   |            |               |            |
   |  Identity  |               |    PDP     |
   |   Server   |               | (optional) |
   |            |               |            |
   +------------+               +------------+

   The Identity Server provisions credentials to each of the workloads.
   At least Workload A (and possibly both) must be provisioned with a
   credential before the call can proceed.  Details of communication
   with the Identity Server are out of scope of this document, however
   we do describe the credential received by the workload.

   PEP is a Policy Enforcement Point, the component that allows the call
   to go through or blocks it.  PDP is an optional Policy Decision
   Point, which may be deployed in architectures where policy management
   is centralized.  All details of policy management and message
   authorization are out of scope of this document.

   The high-level message flow is as follows:

   *  Workload A obtains a credential from the Identity Server.  This
      happens periodically, e.g. once every 24 hours.

   *  Workload A makes an HTTP call into Workload B.  This is a regular
      HTTP request, with the additional protection mechanisms defined
      below.

   *  Workload B now authenticates Workload A and decides whether to
      authorize the call.  In certain architectures, Workload B may need
      to consult with an external server to decide whether to accept the
      call.

   *  Workload B returns a response to Workload A, which may be an error
      response or a regular one.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   This document uses "service" and "workload" interchangeably.
   Otherwise, all terms are as defined by [I-D.ietf-wimse-arch].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  WIMSE Identity

   The WIMSE ID is scoped within a trust domain and therefore any sub
   components (path portion of ID) are only unique within a trust
   domain.  Using a WIMSE ID sub components without taking into account
   the trust domain could allow one domain to issue tokens to spoof
   identities in another domain.  Additionally, the trust domain must be
   tied to an authorized trusted key through some mechanism such as a
   JWKS or X.509 certificate chain.  The association of a trust domain
   and a cryptographic trust root MUST be communicated securely out of
   band.

   [TODO: Should there be a DNS name to Trust domain mapping defined?]

5.2.  WIMSE ID Token and Proof of Possession

   The WIMSE ID token is bound to a secret cryptographic key and is
   always presented with a proof of possession as described in section
   TBD.  The ID Token and its PoP are only used in the application-level
   options, and both are not used in MTLS.  The ID token MUST NOT be
   used as a bearer token.  While this helps reduce the sensitivity of
   the token it is still possible that a token and its proof of
   possession may be captured and replayed.  If this risk is mitigated
   then WIMSE ID tokens may be resued for a period of time with fresh
   proofs generated for each transaction.  The following are some
   mitigations for the capture and reuse of the proof of possession
   (POP):

   *  Preventing Eavesdropping and Interception with TLS

   An attacker observing or intercepting the communication channel can
   view the token and its proof of possession and attempt to replay it
   to gain an advantage.  In order to prevent this the token and proof
   of possession MUST be sent over a secure, server authenticated TLS
   connection unless a secure channel is provided by some other
   mechanisms.  Host name validation according to section TBD MUST be
   performed.  The WIMSE ID token itself is not usable without a proof
   of possession.

   *  Limiting Proof of Possession Lifespan

   The proof of possession MUST be time limited.  A POP should only be
   valid over the time necessary for it to be successfully used for the
   purpose it is needed.  This will typically be on the order of
   minutes.  POPs received outside their validity time MUST be rejected.

   *  Limiting Proof of Possession Scope

   The POP MUST have a limited scope.  Limitations on scope include
   constraining the POP to certain receivers and constraining the POP to
   a usage or transaction.

   *  Binding to a Nonce

   A nonce MAY included in the POP to limit the possibility of replay as
   defined in section TBD.  The POP MAY be bound to a fresh nonce to
   provide single use properties.  A mechanism for distributing a fresh
   challenge nonce to provide single use properties of a POP is outside
   the scope of this specification.

   *  Binding to Sender

   The POP MAY be bound to a sender such as the client identity of a TLS
   session or TLS channel binding parameters.  The mechanisms for
   binding are outside the scope of this specification.

5.3.  Middle Boxes

   In some deployments the WIMSE token and proof of possession may pass
   through multiple systems.  The communication between the systems is
   over TLS, but the token and POP are available in the clear at each
   intermediary.  While the intermediary cannot modify the token or the
   information within the POP they can attempt to capture and replay the
   token or modify the data not protected by the POP.  Mitigations
   listed in the previous section can be used to provide some protection
   from middle boxes.  Deployments should perform analysis on their
   situation to determine if it is appropriate to trust and allow
   traffic to pass through a middle box.

5.4.  Privacy Considerations

   WIMSE tokens and the proofs of possession may contain private
   information such as user names or other identities.  Care should be
   taken to prevent the disclosure of this information.  The use of TLS
   helps protect the privacy of WIMSE tokens and proofs of possession.

   WIMSE tokens are typically associated with a workload that is not
   directly associated with a user, however in some deployments the
   workload may be associated directly to a user.  In these cases the
   WIMSE token can be used to track the user if it is disclosed in clear
   text.

   If the WIMSE ID is used with X.509 certificates then the workload
   identity may be disclosed as part of the TLS handshake.  This can be
   partially mitigated by using TLS 1.3 to protect the client and server
   identities.

6.  IANA Considerations
