                WIMSE Service to Service Authentication
                draft-sheffer-wimse-s2s-protocol-latest

Abstract

   The WIMSE architecture defines authentication and authorization for
   software workloads in a variety of runtime environments, from the
   most basic ones up to complex multi-service, multi-cloud, multi-
   tenant deployments.  This document defines the simplest, atomic unit
   of this architecture: the protocol between two workloads that need to
   verify each other's identity in order to communicate securely.  The
   scope of this protocol is a single HTTP request-and-response pair.
   To address the needs of different setups, we propose two protocols,
   one at the application level and one that makes use of trusted TLS
   transport.  These two protocols are compatible, in the sense that a
   single call chain can have some calls use one protocol and some use
   the other.  Service A can call Service B with mutual TLS
   authentication, while the next call from Service B to Service C would
   be authenticated at the application level.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines authentication and authorization in the context
   of interaction between two workloads.  This is the core component of
   the WIMSE architecture [I-D.ietf-wimse-arch].  Assume that Service A
   needs to call Service B.  For simplicity, this document focuses on
   HTTP-based services, and the service-to-service call consists of a
   single HTTP request and its response.  We define the credentials that
   both services should possess and how they are used to protect the
   HTTP exchange.

   There are multiple deployment styles in use today, and they result in
   different security properties.  We propose to address them
   differently.

   *  Many use cases have various middleboxes inserted between pairs of
      services, resulting in a transport layer that is not end-to-end
      encrypted.  We propose to address these use cases by protecting
      the HTTP messages at the application level (Section 4).

   *  The other commonly deployed architecture has a mutual-TLS
      connection between each pair of services.  This setup can be
      addressed by a simpler solution (Section 5).

   It is an explicit goal of this protocol that a service deployment can
   include both architectures across a multi-chain call.  In other
   words, Service A can call Service B with mutual TLS protection, while
   the next call to Service C is protected at the application level.

   For application-level protection we currently propose two alternative
   solutions, one inspired by DPoP [RFC9449] in Section 4.2 and one
   which is a profile of HTTP Message Signatures [RFC9421] in
   Section 4.3.  The design team believes that we need to pick one of
   these two alternatives for standardization, once we have understood
   their pros and cons.

1.1.  Deployment Architecture and Message Flow

   Regardless of the transport between the workloads, we assume the
   following logical architecture:

   +------------+               +------------+
   |            |               |            |
   |            |               | Workload B |
   | Workload A |==============>|            |
   |            |               |   +--------+
   |            |               |   |  PEP   |
   +------------+               +---+--------+
         ^                        ^     ^
         |                        |     |
         | +----------------------+     |
         | |                            |
         v v                            v
   +------------+               +------------+
   |            |               |            |
   |  Identity  |               |    PDP     |
   |   Server   |               | (optional) |
   |            |               |            |
   +------------+               +------------+

   The Identity Server provisions credentials to each of the workloads.
   At least Workload A (and possibly both) must be provisioned with a
   credential before the call can proceed.  Details of communication
   with the Identity Server are out of scope of this document, however
   we do describe the credential received by the workload.

   PEP is a Policy Enforcement Point, the component that allows the call
   to go through or blocks it.  PDP is an optional Policy Decision
   Point, which may be deployed in architectures where policy management
   is centralized.  All details of policy management and message
   authorization are out of scope of this document.

   The high-level message flow is as follows:

   *  Workload A obtains a credential from the Identity Server.  This
      happens periodically, e.g. once every 24 hours.

   *  Workload A makes an HTTP call into Workload B.  This is a regular
      HTTP request, with the additional protection mechanisms defined
      below.

   *  Workload B now authenticates Workload A and decides whether to
      authorize the call.  In certain architectures, Workload B may need
      to consult with an external server to decide whether to accept the
      call.

   *  Workload B returns a response to Workload A, which may be an error
      response or a regular one.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   This document uses "service" and "workload" interchangeably.
   Otherwise, all terms are as defined by [I-D.ietf-wimse-arch].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Workload Identity

   This document defines a workload identity as a URI [RFC3986].  This
   URI is used in the subject fields in the certificates and tokens
   defined later in this document.  This specification treats the URI as
   opaque.  The format of the URI and the namespace for the URI are at
   the discretion of the deployment at large.  Other specifications may
   define specific URI structures for particular use cases.  An example
   of a defined identity format is the SPIFFE ID
   (https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/blob/main/standards/SPIFFE-ID.md).

   A workload identity only has meaning within the scope of a specific
   issuer.  Two identities of the same value issued by different issuers
   may or may not refer to the same workload.  In order to avoid
   collisions identity URIs SHOULD specify, in the URI's "authority"
   field, the trust domain associated with an issuer that is selected
   from a global name space such as host domains.  However, the
   validator of an identity credential MUST make sure that they are
   using the correct issuer credential to verify the identity credential
   and that the issuer is trusted to issue tokens for the defined trust
   domain.

4.  Application Level Service To Service Authentication

   As noted in the Introduction, for many deployments communication
   between workloads cannot use end-to-end TLS.  For these deployment
   styles, this document proposes application-level protections.

   The current version of the document includes two alternatives, both
   using the newly introduced Workload Identity Token (Section 4.1).
   The first alternative (Section 4.2) is inspired by the OAuth DPoP
   specification.  The second (Section 4.3) is based on the HTTP Message
   Signatures RFC.  We present both alternatives and expect the working
   group to select one of them as this document progresses towards IETF
   consensus.

4.1.  The Workload Identity Token

   The Workload Identity Token (WIT) is a JWS [RFC7515] signed JWT
   [RFC7519] that represents the identity of a workload.  It is issued
   by the Identity Server and binds a public key to the workload
   identity.  A WIT MUST contain the following:

   *  in the JOSE header:

      -  alg: An identifier for a JWS asymmetric digital signature
         algorithm (registered algorithm identifiers are listed in the
         IANA JOSE Algorithms registry [IANA.JOSE.ALGS]).  The value
         none MUST NOT be used.

      -  typ: the WIT is explicitly typed, as recommended in
         Section 3.11 of [RFC8725], using the wimse-id+jwt media type.

   *  in the JWT claims:

      -  iss: The issuer of the token, which is the Identity Server,
         represented by a URI.

      -  sub: The subject of the token, which is the identity of the
         workload, represented by a URI.

      -  exp: The expiration time of the token (as defined in
         Section 4.1.4 of [RFC7519]).  WITs should be refreshed
         regularly, e.g. on the order of hours.

      -  jti: A unique identifier for the token.

      -  cnf: A confirmation claim containing the public key of the
         workload using the jwk member as defined in Section 3.2 of
         [RFC7800].  The workload MUST prove possession of the
         corresponding private key when presenting the WIT to another
         party, which can be accomplished by using it in conjunction
         with one of the methods in Section 4.2 or Section 4.3.  As
         such, it MUST NOT be used as a bearer token and is not intended
         for use in the Authorization header.

   An example WIT might look like this (all examples, of course, are
   non-normative and with line breaks and extra space for readability):

   }

                     Figure 2: Example WIT JOSE Header

   The decoded JWT claims of the WIT from the example above are shown
   here:

   {
    "iss": "wimse://example.com/trusted-central-authority",
    "exp": 1717612470,
    "sub": "wimse://example.com/specific-workload",

      "crv": "Ed25519",
      "x": "_amRC3YrYbHhH1RtYrL8cSmTDMhYtOUTG78cGTR5ezk"
     }
    }
   }

                        Figure 3: Example WIT Claims

   The claims indicate that the example WIT:

   *  was issued by an Identity Server known as wimse://example.com/
      trusted-central-authority.

   *  is valid until May 15, 2024 3:28:45 PM GMT-06:00 (represented as
      NumericDate Section 2 of [RFC7519] value 1717612470).

   *  identifies the workload to which the token was issued as
      wimse://example.com/specific-workload.

   *  has a unique identifier of x-_1CTL2cca3CSE4cwb__.

   *  binds the public key represented by the jwk confirmation method to
      the workload wimse://example.com/specific-workload.

   For elucidative purposes only, the workload's key, including the
   private part, is shown below in JWK [RFC7517] format:

   {
    "kty":"OKP",
    "crv":"Ed25519",
    "x":"_amRC3YrYbHhH1RtYrL8cSmTDMhYtOUTG78cGTR5ezk",
    "d":"G4lGAYFtFq5rwyjlgSIRznIoCF7MtKDHByyUUZCqLiA"
   }

                      Figure 4: Example Workload's Key

   The afore-exampled WIT is signed with the private key of the Identity
   Server.  The public key(s) of the Identity Server need to be known to
   all workloads in order to verify the signature of the WIT.  The
   Identity Server's public key from this example is shown below in JWK
   [RFC7517] format:

   {
    "kty":"EC",
    "kid":"June 5",
    "x":"kXqnA2Op7hgd4zRMbw0iFcc_hDxUxhojxOFVGjE2gks",
    "y":"n__VndPMR021-59UAs0b9qDTFT-EZtT6xSNs_xFskLo",
    "crv":"P-256"
   }

4.1.1.  The WIT HTTP Header

   A WIT is conveyed in an HTTP header field named Workload-Identity-
   Token.

   For those who celebrate, ABNF [RFC5234] for the value of Workload-
   Identity-Token header field is provided in Figure 6:

   ALPHA = %x41-5A / %x61-7A ; A-Z / a-z
   DIGIT = %x30-39 ; 0-9
   base64url = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_")
   WIT =  base64url "." base64url "." base64url

            Figure 6: Workload-Identity-Token Header Field ABNF

   The following shows the WIT from Figure 1 in an example of a
   Workload-Identity-Token header field:

       Figure 7: An example Workload Identity Token HTTP Header Field

   Note that per [RFC9110], header field names are case insensitive;
   thus, Workload-Identity-Token, workload-identity-token, WORKLOAD-
   IDENTITY-TOKEN, etc., are all valid and equivalent header field
   names.  However, case is significant in the header field value.

4.2.  Option 1: DPoP-Inspired Authentication

   This option, inspired by the OAuth DPoP specification [RFC9449], uses
   a DPoP-like mechanism to authenticate the calling workload in the
   context of the request.  The WIMSE Identity Token (Section 4.1) is
   sent in the request as described in Section 4.1.1.  An additional
   JWT, the Workload Proof Token (WPT), is signed by the private key
   corresponding to the public key in the WIT.  The WPT is sent in the
   Workload-Proof-Token header field of the request.  A WPT contains the
   following:

   *  in the JOSE header:

      -  alg: An identifier for an appropriate JWS asymmetric digital
         signature algorithm corresponding to the confirmation key in
         the associated WIT.

      -  typ: the WPT is explicitly typed, as recommended in
         Section 3.11 of [RFC8725], using the application/wimse-
         proof+jwt media type.

   *  in the JWT claims:

      -  iss: The issuer of the token, which is the calling workload,
         represented by the same value as the sub claim of the
         associated WIT.

      -  aud: The audience of the token contains the HTTP target URI
         (Section 7.1 of [RFC9110]) of the request to which the WPT is
         attached, without query or fragment parts.

      -  exp: The expiration time of the WIT (as defined in
         Section 4.1.4 of [RFC7519]).  WPT lifetimes MUST be short,
         e.g., on the order of minutes or seconds.

      -  jti: A unique identifier for the token.

      -  ath: Hash of the OAuth access token, if present in the request,
         which might convey end-user identity and authorization context
         of the request.  The value, as per Section 4.1 of [RFC9449], is
         the base64url encoding of the SHA-256 hash of the ASCII
         encoding of the access token's value.

      -  tth: Hash of the Txn-Token [I-D.ietf-oauth-transaction-tokens],
         if present in the request, which might convey end-user identity
         and authorization context of the request.  The value MUST be
         the result of a base64url encoding (as defined in Section 2 of
         [RFC7515]) of the SHA-256 hash of the ASCII encoding of the
         associated token's value.

      -  oth: Hash of any other token in the request that might convey
         end-user identity and authorization context of the request.
         The value MUST be the result of a base64url encoding (as
         defined in Section 2 of [RFC7515]) of the SHA-256 hash of the
         ASCII encoding of the associated token's value.  (note: this is
         less than ideal but seems we need something like this for
         extensibility)

   An example WPT might look like the following:

              Figure 11: Example HTTP Request with WIT and WPT

   To validate the WPT in the request, the recipient MUST ensure the
   following:

   *  There is exactly one Workload-Proof-Token header field in the
      request.

   *  The Workload-Proof-Token header field value is a single and well-
      formed JWT.

   *  The WPT signature is valid using the public key from the
      confirmation claim of the WIT.

   *  The typ JOSE header parameter of the WPT conveys a media type of
      wimse-proof+jwt.

   *  The iss claim of the WPT matches the sub claim of the WIT. (note:
      not sure iss in the WPT is useful or necessary)

   *  The aud claim of the WPT matches the target URI, or an acceptable
      alias or normalization thereof, of the HTTP request in which the
      WPT was received, ignoring any query and fragment parts.

   *  The exp claim is present and conveys a time that has not passed.
      WPTs with an expiration time unreasonably far in the future SHOULD
      be rejected.

   *  Optionally, check that the value of the jti claim has not been
      used before in the time window in which the respective WPT would
      be considered valid.

   *  If presented in conjunction with an OAuth access token, the value
      of the ath claim matches the hash of that token's value.

   *  If presented in conjunction with a Txn-Token, the value of the tth
      claim matches the hash of that token's value.

   *  If presented in conjunction with a token conveying end-user
      identity or authorization context, the value of the oth claim
      matches the hash of that token's value.

4.3.  Option 2: Authentication Based on HTTP Message Signatures

   This option uses the WIMSE Identity Token (Section 4.1) to sign the
   request and optionally, the response.  This specification defines a
   profile of the Message Signatures specification [RFC9421].

   The request is signed as per [RFC9421].  The following derived
   components MUST be signed:

   *  @method

   *  @request-target

   In addition, the following request headers MUST be signed when they
   exist:

   *  Content-Type

   *  Content-Digest

   *  Authorization

   *  Txn-Token [I-D.ietf-oauth-transaction-tokens]

   *  Workload-Identity-Token

   If the response is signed, the following components MUST be signed:

   *  @status

   *  @method;req

   *  @request-target;req

   *  Content-Type if it exists

   *  Content-Digest if it exists

   *  Workload-Identity-Token

   For both requests and responses, the following signature parameters
   MUST be included:

   *  created

   *  expires - expiration MUST be short, e.g. on the order of minutes.
      The WIMSE architecture will provide separate mechanisms in support
      of long-lived compute processes.

   *  nonce

   *  tag - the value for implementations of this specification is
      wimse-service-to-service

   Since the signing key is sent along with the message, the keyid
   parameter SHOULD NOT be used.

   It is RECOMMENDED to include only one signature with the HTTP
   message.  If multiple ones are included, then the signature label
   included in both the Signature-Input and Signature headers SHOULD be
   wimse.

   A sender MUST ensure that each nonce it generates is unique, at least
   among messages sent to the same recipient.  To detect message
   replays, a recipient MAY reject a message (request or response) if a
   nonce is repeated.

   To promote interoperability, the ecdsa-p256-sha256 signing algorithm
   MUST be implemented by general purpose implementations of this spec.


   // OPEN ISSUE: do we use the `Accept-Signature` field to signal that
   // the response must be signed?

   Following is a non-normative example of a signed request and a signed
   response, where the caller is using the keys specified in Figure 4.

    "crv":"Ed25519",

   }

   A signed response would be:

5.  Using Mutual TLS for Service To Service Authentication

   The WIMSE workload identity may be carried within an X.509
   certificate.  The WIMSE workload identity MUST be encoded in a
   SubjectAltName extension of type URI.  There MUST be only one
   SubjectAltName extension of type URI in a WIMSE certificate.  The
   WIMSE certificate may contain SubjectAltName extensions of other
   types such as DNSName.

   WIMSE identities may be used to validate server and client
   connections.  When validating a WIMSE identity the relying party MUST
   validate that the CA issuer for the WIMSE identity is authorized to
   issue certificates for the trust domain of the WIMSE identity in the
   certificate.  Other PKIX path validation rules apply.

   Servers wishing to use the WIMSE identity for authorizing the client
   MUST require client certificate authentication in the TLS handshake.
   Other methods of post handshake authentication are not specified by
   this document.

   WIMSE clients and servers MUST validate that the trust domain portion
   of the WIMSE certificate matches the expected trust domain for the
   other side of the connection.

5.1.  Host Name Validation


   // TODO: need to define trust root used to validate the certificate
   // is appropriate for the trust domain.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the server certificate contain a DNS SAN that
   the client can use to perform standard host name validation
   (Section 6.3 of [RFC9525]).  The client SHOULD also extract the WIMSE
   identity from the certificate if it is present and validate that the
   WIMSE trust domain matches the intended trust domain for the server.
   The client MAY then further use the WIMSE identity in applying
   authorization policy to the server.  If the client does not use the
   DNS SAN then the client MUST match the WIMSE identity in the
   certificate against the WIMSE identity of the workload of the
   intended server according to a locally defined policy.  The host
   portion of the WIMSE URI is NOT treated as a host name as specified
   in section 6.4 of [RFC9525] but rather as a trust domain.  The server
   identity is encoded in the path portion of the WIMSE identity in a
   deployment specific way.

5.2.  Authorization Using the WIMSE Identity

   The client or server application may retrieve the WIMSE identity from
   the TLS layer for use in authorization, accounting and auditing.  For
   example, the full URI may be matched against ACLs and other policy
   constructs to authorize actions requested by the peer.

6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  WIMSE Identity

   The WIMSE ID is scoped within an issuer and therefore any sub-
   components (path portion of ID) are only unique within a trust domain
   defined by the issuer.  Using a WIMSE ID without taking into account
   the trust domain could allow one domain to issue tokens to spoof
   identities in another domain.  Additionally, the trust domain must be
   tied to an authorized issuer cryptographic trust root through some
   mechanism such as a JWKS or X.509 certificate chain.  The association
   of an issuer, trust domain and a cryptographic trust root MUST be
   communicated securely out of band.


   // TODO: Should there be a DNS name to Trust domain mapping defined
   // or some other discovery mechanism?

6.2.  Workload ID Token and Proof of Possession

   The Workload ID token (WIT) is bound to a secret cryptographic key
   and is always presented with a proof of possession as described in
   Section 4.1.  The WIT is a general purpose token that can be
   presented in multiple contexts.  The WIT and its PoP are only used in
   the application-level options, and both are not used in MTLS.  The
   WIT MUST NOT be used as a bearer token.  While this helps reduce the
   sensitivity of the token it is still possible that a token and its
   proof of possession may be captured and replayed within the PoP's
   lifetime.  The following are some mitigations for the capture and
   reuse of the proof of possession (PoP):

   *  Preventing Eavesdropping and Interception with TLS

   An attacker observing or intercepting the communication channel can
   view the token and its proof of possession and attempt to replay it
   to gain an advantage.  In order to prevent this the token and proof
   of possession MUST be sent over a secure, server authenticated TLS
   connection unless a secure channel is provided by some other
   mechanisms.  Host name validation according to Section 5 MUST be
   performed.  The WIT itself is not usable without a proof of
   possession.

   *  Limiting Proof of Possession Lifespan

   The proof of possession MUST be time limited.  A PoP should only be
   valid over the time necessary for it to be successfully used for the
   purpose it is needed.  This will typically be on the order of
   minutes.  PoPs received outside their validity time MUST be rejected.

   *  Limiting Proof of Possession Scope

   In order to reduce the risk of theft and replay the PoP should have a
   limited scope.  For example, a PoP may be targeted for use with a
   specific workload and even a specific transaction to reduce the
   impact of a stolen PoP.  In some cases a workload may wish to reuse a
   PoP for a period of time or have it accepted by multiple target
   workloads.  A careful analysis is warranted to understand the impacts
   to the system if a PoP is disclosed allowing it to be presented by an
   attacker along with a captured WIT.

   *  Binding to a Timestamp or Nonce

   A proof of possession should include information that can be used to
   uniquely identify it such as a unique timestamp or nonce.  This can
   be used by the receiver to perform basic replay protection against
   tokens it has already seen.  Depending upon the design of the system
   it may be difficult to synchronize the replay cache across all token
   validators.  In this case, if the PoP is not sufficiently scoped it
   may be usable with another workload.  While a fresh nonce could be
   included in the PoP, a mechanism for distributing a fresh challenge
   nonce from the validator to provide single use properties of a PoP is
   outside the scope of this specification.

   *  Binding to TLS Endpoint

   The POP MAY be bound to a transport layer sender such as the client
   identity of a TLS session or TLS channel binding parameters.  The
   mechanisms for binding are outside the scope of this specification.

6.3.  Middle Boxes

   In some deployments the WIMSE token and proof of possession may pass
   through multiple systems.  The communication between the systems is
   over TLS, but the token and PoP are available in the clear at each
   intermediary.  While the intermediary cannot modify the token or the
   information within the PoP they can attempt to capture and replay the
   token or modify the data not protected by the PoP.  Mitigations
   listed in the previous section can be used to provide some protection
   from middle boxes.  Deployments should perform analysis on their
   situation to determine if it is appropriate to trust and allow
   traffic to pass through a middle box.

6.4.  Privacy Considerations

   WITs and the proofs of possession may contain private information
   such as user names or other identities.  Care should be taken to
   prevent the disclosure of this information.  The use of TLS helps
   protect the privacy of WITs and proofs of possession.

   WITs and certificates with WIMSE identifiers are typically associated
   with a workload and not a specific user, however in some deployments
   the workload may be associated directly to a user.  While these are
   exceptional cases a deployment should evaluate if the disclosure of
   WITs or certificates can be used to track a user.

7.  IANA Considerations

   TODO: maybe a URI Scheme registration of wimse in URI schemes
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtml) per
   [RFC7595] but it's only being used in an example right now and might
   not even be appropriate.  Or maybe use an ietf URI scheme a la URN
   Namespace for IETF Use (https://www.iana.org/assignments/params/
   params.xhtml) somehow.  Or maybe nothing.  Or maybe something else.

   TODO: tth and maybe oth claim in JSON Web Token Claims Registry
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml)

7.1.  Media Type Registration

   TODO: application/wimse-id+jwt or appropriately bikeshedded media
   type name (despite my ongoing unease with using media types for
   typing JWTs) in Media Types (https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-
   types/media-types.xhtml).

   TODO: application/wimse-proof+jwt ...
