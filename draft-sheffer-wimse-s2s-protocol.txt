1.  Introduction

   This document defines authentication and authorization in the context
   of interaction between two workloads.  This is the core component of
   the WIMSE architecture [I-D.ietf-wimse-arch].  Assume that Service A
   needs to call Service B.  For simplicity, this document focuses on
   HTTP-based services, and the service-to-service call consists of a
   single HTTP request and its response.  We define the credentials that
   both services should possess and how they are used to protect the
   HTTP exchange.

   There are multiple deployment styles in use today, and they result in
   different security properties.  We propose to address them
   differently.

   *  Many use cases have various middleboxes inserted between pairs of
      services, resulting in a transport layer that is not end-to-end
      encrypted.  We propose to address these use cases by protecting
      the HTTP messages at the application level (Section 3).

   *  The other commonly deployed architecture has a mutual-TLS
      connection between each pair of services.  This setup can be
      addressed by a simpler solution (Section 4).

   It is an explicit goal of this protocol that a service deployment can
   include both architectures across a multi-chain call.  In other
   words, Service A can call Service B with mutual TLS protection, while
   the next call to Service C is protected at the application level.

   For application-level protection we currently propose two alternative
   solutions, one inspired by DPoP [RFC9449] and one which is a profile
   of HTTP Message Signatures [RFC9421].  The design team believes that
   we need to pick one of these two alternatives for standardization,
   once we have understood their pros and cons.

1.1.  Deployment Architecture and Message Flow

   Regardless of the transport between the workloads, we assume the
   following logical architecture:

   +------------+               +------------+
   |            |               |            |
   |            |               | Workload B |
   | Workload A |==============>|            |
   |            |               |   +--------+
   |            |               |   |  PEP   |
   +------------+               +---+--------+
         ^                        ^     ^
         |                        |     |
         | +----------------------+     |
         | |                            |
         v v                            v
   +------------+               +------------+
   |            |               |            |
   |  Identity  |               |    PDP     |
   |   Server   |               | (optional) |
   |            |               |            |
   +------------+               +------------+

   The Identity Server provisions credentials to each of the workloads.
   At least Workload A (and possibly both) must be provisioned with a
   credential before the call can proceed.  Details of communication
   with the Identity Server are out of scope of this document, however
   we do describe the credential received by the workload.

   PEP is a Policy Enforcement Point, the component that allows the call
   to go through or blocks it.  PDP is an optional Policy Decision
   Point, which may be deployed in architectures where policy management
   is centralized.  All details of policy management and message
   authorization are out of scope of this document.

   The high-level message flow is as follows:

   *  Workload A obtains a credential from the Identity Server.  This
      happens periodically, e.g. once every 24 hours.

   *  Workload A makes an HTTP call into Workload B.  This is a regular
      HTTP request, with the additional protection mechanisms defined
      below.

   *  Workload B now authenticates Workload A and decides whether to
      authorize the call.  In certain architectures, Workload B may need
      to consult with an external server to decide whether to accept the
      call.

   *  Workload B returns a response to Workload A, which may be an error
      response or a regular one.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   This document uses "service" and "workload" interchangeably.
   Otherwise, all terms are as defined by [I-D.ietf-wimse-arch].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Application Level Service To Service Authentication

3.1.  The WIMSE ID Token

3.2.  Option 1: DPoP-Inspired Authentication

3.3.  Option 2: Authentication Based on HTTP Message Signatures

   This option uses the WIMSE Identity Token (ref TBD) to sign the
   request and optionally, the response.  This specification defines a
   profile of the Message Signatures specification [RFC9421].

   The request is signed as per [RFC9421].  The following derived
   components MUST be signed:

   *  @method

   *  @request-target

   In addition, the following headers MUST be signed when they exist:

   *  Content-Type

   *  Content-Digest

   *  Authorization

   *  Txn-Token [I-D.ietf-oauth-transaction-tokens]

   *  Workload-Identity-Token

   If the response is signed, the following components MUST be signed:

   *  @status

   *  @method;req

   *  @request-target;req

   *  Content-Type if it exists

   *  Content-Digest if it exists

   *  Workload-Identity-Token

   For both requests and responses, the following signature parameters
   MUST be included:

   *  created

   *  expires - expiration MUST be short, e.g. on the order of minutes.
      The WIMSE architecture will provide seperate mechanisms in support
      of long-lived compute processes.

   *  nonce

   *  tag - the value for implementations of this specification is
      wimse-service-to-service

   Since the signing key is sent along with the message, the keyid
   parameter SHOULD NOT be used.

   It is RECOMMENDED to include only one signature with the HTTP
   message.  If multiple ones are included, then the signature label
   included in both the Signature-Input and Signature headers SHOULD be
   wimse.

   A sender MUST ensure that each nonce it generates is unique, at least
   among messages sent to the same recipient.  To detect message
   replays, a recipient MAY reject a message (request or response) if a
   nonce is repeated.

   To promote interoperability, the ecdsa-p256-sha256 signing algorithm
   MUST be implemented by general purpose implementations of this spec.

   OPEN ISSUE: do we use the Accept-Signature field to signal that the
   response must be signed?

   Following is a non-normative example of a signed request and a signed
   response, using the keys mentioned in Section TBD.

   GET /gimme-ice-cream?flavor=vanilla HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Signature: wimse=:K4dfGnguF5f1L4DKBSp5XeFXosLGj8Y9fiUX06rL/wdOF+x3zTWmsvKWiY0B1oFZaOtm2FHru+YLjdkqa2WfCQ==:
   Signature-Input: wimse=("@method" "@request-target" "workload-identity-token");created=1718291357;expires=1718291657;nonce="abcd1111";tag="wimse-service-to-service"
   Workload-Identity-Token: aGVhZGVyCg.VGhpcyBpcyBub3QgYSByZWFsIHRva2VuLgo.c2lnbmF0dXJlCg

   Assuming that the workload being called has the following keypair:

   {
    "kty":"OKP",
    "crv":"Ed25519",
    "x":"CfaY1XX-aHJpenRP8ATm3yGlbcKA_treqOfwKrilwyg",
    "d":"fycSKS-iHZ6TC1BNwN6cE0sOBP3-4KgR-eqxNpnyhws"
   }

   A signed response would be:

   HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
   Connection: close
   Content-Digest: sha-256=:47DEQpj8HBSa+/TImW+5JCeuQeRkm5NMpJWZG3hSuFU=:
   Content-Type: text/plain
   Signature: wimse=:NMrMn3xhI6m9PI8mKVfpnH5qFGcEfuFxiCmsB5PJhGjUHT/5J4612EZwRw3V4kU4gGJmO+ER8RC4DM2HKVOYDQ==:
   Signature-Input: wimse=("@status" "workload-identity-token" "content-type" "content-digest" "@method";req "@request-target";req);created=1718295368;expires=1718295670;nonce="abcd2222";tag="wimse-service-to-service"
   Workload-Identity-Token: aGVhZGVyCg.VGhpcyBhaW4ndCBvbmUsIHRvby4K.c2lnbmF0dXJlCg

   No ice cream today.
