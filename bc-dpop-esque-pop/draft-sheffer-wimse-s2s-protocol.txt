1.  Introduction

   This document defines authentication and authorization in the context
   of interaction between two workloads.  This is the core component of
   the WIMSE architecture [I-D.ietf-wimse-arch].  Assume that Service A
   needs to call Service B.  For simplicity, this document focuses on
   HTTP-based services, and the service-to-service call consists of a
   single HTTP request and its response.  We define the credentials that
   both services should possess and how they are used to protect the
   HTTP exchange.

   There are multiple deployment styles in use today, and they result in
   different security properties.  We propose to address them
   differently.

   *  Many use cases have various middleboxes inserted between pairs of
      services, resulting in a transport layer that is not end-to-end
      encrypted.  We propose to address these use cases by protecting
      the HTTP messages at the application level (Section 3).

   *  The other commonly deployed architecture has a mutual-TLS
      connection between each pair of services.  This setup can be
      addressed by a simpler solution (Section 4).

   It is an explicit goal of this protocol that a service deployment can
   include both architectures across a multi-chain call.  In other
   words, Service A can call Service B with mutual TLS protection, while
   the next call to Service C is protected at the application level.

   For application-level protection we currently propose two alternative
   solutions, one inspired by DPoP [RFC9449] in Section 3.2 and one
   which is a profile of HTTP Message Signatures [RFC9421] in
   Section 3.3.  The design team believes that we need to pick one of
   these two alternatives for standardization, once we have understood
   their pros and cons.

1.1.  Deployment Architecture and Message Flow

   Regardless of the transport between the workloads, we assume the
   following logical architecture:

   +------------+               +------------+
   |            |               |            |
   |            |               | Workload B |
   | Workload A |==============>|            |
   |            |               |   +--------+
   |            |               |   |  PEP   |
   +------------+               +---+--------+
         ^                        ^     ^
         |                        |     |
         | +----------------------+     |
         | |                            |
         v v                            v
   +------------+               +------------+
   |            |               |            |
   |  Identity  |               |    PDP     |
   |   Server   |               | (optional) |
   |            |               |            |
   +------------+               +------------+

   The Identity Server provisions credentials to each of the workloads.
   At least Workload A (and possibly both) must be provisioned with a
   credential before the call can proceed.  Details of communication
   with the Identity Server are out of scope of this document, however
   we do describe the credential received by the workload.

   PEP is a Policy Enforcement Point, the component that allows the call
   to go through or blocks it.  PDP is an optional Policy Decision
   Point, which may be deployed in architectures where policy management
   is centralized.  All details of policy management and message
   authorization are out of scope of this document.

   The high-level message flow is as follows:

   *  Workload A obtains a credential from the Identity Server.  This
      happens periodically, e.g. once every 24 hours.

   *  Workload A makes an HTTP call into Workload B.  This is a regular
      HTTP request, with the additional protection mechanisms defined
      below.

   *  Workload B now authenticates Workload A and decides whether to
      authorize the call.  In certain architectures, Workload B may need
      to consult with an external server to decide whether to accept the
      call.

   *  Workload B returns a response to Workload A, which may be an error
      response or a regular one.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   This document uses "service" and "workload" interchangeably.
   Otherwise, all terms are as defined by [I-D.ietf-wimse-arch].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Application Level Service To Service Authentication

   As noted in the Introduction, there are commonly deployments where
   communication between workloads cannot use end-to-end TLS.  For these
   deployment styles, this document proposes application-level
   protections.

   The current version of the document includes two alternatives, both
   using the newly introduced Workload Identity Token Section 3.1.  The
   first alternative Section 3.2 is inspired by the OAuth DPoP
   specification.  The second Section 3.3 is based on the HTTP Message
   Signatures RFC.  We present both alternatives and expect the working
   group to select one of them as this document progresses towards IETF
   consensus.

3.1.  The Workload Identity Token

   The Workload Identity Token (WIT) is a JWS [RFC7515] signed JWT
   [RFC7519] that represents the identity of a workload.  It is issued
   by the Identity Server and binds a public key to the workload
   identity.  A WIT MUST contain the following:

   *  in the JOSE header:

      -  alg: An identifier for a JWS asymmetric digital signature
         algorithm (registered algorithm identifiers are listed in the
         IANA JOSE Algorithms registry [IANA.JOSE.ALGS]).  The value
         none MUST NOT be used.

      -  typ: the WIT is explicitly typed, as recommended in
         Section 3.11 of [RFC8725], using the wimse-id+jwt media type.

   *  in the JWT claims:

      -  iss: The issuer of the token, which is the Identity Server,
         represented by a URI.

      -  sub: The subject of the token, which is the identity of the
         workload, represented by a URI.

      -  exp: The expiration time of the token (as defined in
         Section 4.1.4 of [RFC7519]).  WITs should be refreshed
         regularly, e.g. on the order of hours.

      -  jti: A unique identifier for the token.

      -  cnf: A confirmation claim containing the public key of the
         workload using the jwk member as defined in Section 3.2 of
         [RFC7800].  The workload MUST prove possession of the
         corresponding private key when presenting the WIT to another
         party, which can be accomplished by using it in conjunction
         with one of the methods in Section 3.2 or Section 3.3.  As
         such, it MUST NOT be used as a bearer token and is not intended
         for use in the Authorization header.

   An example WIT might look like this (all examples, of course, are
   non-normative and with line breaks and extra space for readability):

   The decoded JOSE header of the WIT from the example above is shown
   here:

   {
    "typ": "wimse-id+jwt",
    "alg": "ES256",
    "kid": "June 5"
   }

                     Figure 2: Example WIT JOSE Header

   The decoded JWT claims of the WIT from the example above are shown
   here:

   {
    "iss": "wimse://example.com/trusted-central-authority",
    "exp": 1717612470,
    "sub": "wimse://example.com/specific-workload",
    "jti": "x-_1CTL2cca3CSE4cwb__",
    "cnf": {
     "jwk": {
      "kty": "OKP",
      "crv": "Ed25519",
      "x": "_amRC3YrYbHhH1RtYrL8cSmTDMhYtOUTG78cGTR5ezk"
     }
    }
   }

                        Figure 3: Example WIT Claims

   The claims indicate that the example WIT:

   *  was issued by an Identity Server known as wimse://example.com/
      trusted-central-authority.

   *  is valid until May 15, 2024 3:28:45 PM GMT-06:00 (represented as
      NumericDate Section 2 of [RFC7519] value 1717612470).

   *  identifies the workload to which the token was issued as
      wimse://example.com/specific-workload.

   *  has a unique identifier of x-_1CTL2cca3CSE4cwb__.

   *  binds the public key represented by the jwk confirmation method to
      the workload wimse://example.com/specific-workload.

   For elucidative purposes only, the workload's key, including the
   private part, is shown below in JWK [RFC7517] format:

   {
    "kty":"OKP",
    "crv":"Ed25519",
    "x":"_amRC3YrYbHhH1RtYrL8cSmTDMhYtOUTG78cGTR5ezk",
    "d":"G4lGAYFtFq5rwyjlgSIRznIoCF7MtKDHByyUUZCqLiA"
   }

                      Figure 4: Example Workload's Key

   The afore-exampled WIT is signed with the private key of the Identity
   Server.  The public key(s) of the Identity Server need to be known to
   all workloads in order to verify the signature of the WIT.  The
   Identity Server's public key from this example is shown below in JWK
   [RFC7517] format:

   {
    "kty":"EC",
    "kid":"June 5",
    "x":"kXqnA2Op7hgd4zRMbw0iFcc_hDxUxhojxOFVGjE2gks",
    "y":"n__VndPMR021-59UAs0b9qDTFT-EZtT6xSNs_xFskLo",
    "crv":"P-256"
   }

3.1.1.  The WIT HTTP Header

   A WIT is conveyed in an HTTP header field named Workload-Identity-
   Token.

   For those who celebrate, ABNF [RFC5234] for the value of Workload-
   Identity-Token header field is provided in Figure 6:

   ALPHA = %x41-5A / %x61-7A ; A-Z / a-z
   DIGIT = %x30-39 ; 0-9
   base64url = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_")
   WIT =  base64url "." base64url "." base64url

            Figure 6: Workload-Identity-Token Header Field ABNF

   The following shows the WIT from the Figure 1 in an example of a
   Workload-Identity-Token header field:

    6eL1M486XmRgl3uyjj6R_iuzNOA

       Figure 7: An example Workload Identity Token HTTP Header Field

   Note that per [RFC9110], header field names are case insensitive;
   thus, Workload-Identity-Token, workload-identity-token, WORKLOAD-
   IDENTITY-TOKEN, etc., are all valid and equivalent header field
   names.  However, case is significant in the header field value.

3.2.  Option 1: DPoP-Inspired Authentication

   This option, inspired by the OAuth DPoP specification [RFC9449], uses
   a DPoP-like mechanism to authenticate the calling workload in the
   context of the request.  The WIMSE Identity Token Section 3.1 is sent
   in the request as described in Section 3.1.1.  An additional JWT, the
   Workload Proof Token (WPT), is signed by the private key
   corresponding to the public key in the WIT.  The WPT is sent in the
   Workload-Proof-Token header field of the request.  A WPT contains the
   following:

   *  in the JOSE header:

      -  alg: An identifier for an appropriate JWS asymmetric digital
         signature algorithm corresponding to the confirmation key in
         the associated WIT.

      -  typ: the WPT is explicitly typed, as recommended in
         Section 3.11 of [RFC8725], using the application/wimse-
         proof+jwt media type.

   *  in the JWT claims:

      -  iss: The issuer of the token, which is the calling workload,
         represented by the same value as the sub claim of the
         associated WIT.

      -  aud: The audience of the token contains the HTTP target URI
         (Section 7.1 of [RFC9110]) of the request to which the WPT is
         attached, without query or fragment parts.

      -  exp: The expiration time of the WIT (as defined in
         Section 4.1.4 of [RFC7519]).  WPT lifetimes MUST be short,
         e.g., on the order of minutes or seconds.

      -  jti: A unique identifier for the token.

      -  ctx_token_hash: Hash of the OAuth access token, Transaction
         Token [I-D.ietf-oauth-transaction-tokens], or other token in
         the request that might convey end-user identity and
         authorization context of the request.  The value MUST be the
         result of a base64url encoding (as defined in Section 2 of
         [RFC7515]) the SHA-256 hash of the ASCII encoding of the
         associated token's value.

   An example WPT might look like the following:

              Figure 11: Example HTTP Request with WIT and WPT

   To validate the WPT in the request, the recipient MUST ensure the
   following:

   *  There is exactly one Workload-Proof-Token header field in the
      request.

   *  The Workload-Proof-Token header field value is a single and well-
      formed JWT.

   *  The WPT signature is valid using the public key from the
      confirmation claim of the WIT.

   *  The typ JOSE header parameter of the WPT conveys a media type of
      wimse-proof+jwt.

   *  The iss claim of the WPT matches the sub claim of the WIT. (note:
      not sure iss in the WPT is necessary)

   *  The aud claim of the WPT matches the target URI, or an acceptable
      alias or normalization thereof, of the HTTP request in which the
      WPT was received, ignoring any query and fragment parts.

   *  The exp claim is present and conveys a time that has not passed.
      WPTs with an expiration time unreasonably far in the future SHOULD
      be rejected.

   *  Optionally, check that the value of the jti claim has not been
      used before in the time window in which the respective WPT would
      be considered valid.

   *  If presented in conjunction with a token conveying end-user
      identity or authorization context, the value of the ctx_token_hash
      claim matches the hash of that token's value.

3.3.  Option 2: Authentication Based on HTTP Message Signatures

   This option uses the WIMSE Identity Token (ref TBD) to sign the
   request and optionally, the response.  This specification defines a
   profile of the Message Signatures specification [RFC9421].

   The request is signed as per [RFC9421].  The following derived
   components MUST be signed:

   *  @method

   *  @request-target

   In addition, the following headers MUST be signed when they exist:

   *  Content-Type

   *  Content-Digest

   *  Authorization

   *  Txn-Token [I-D.ietf-oauth-transaction-tokens]

   *  Workload-Identity-Token

   If the response is signed, the following components MUST be signed:

   *  @status

   *  @method;req

   *  @request-target;req

   *  Content-Type if it exists

   *  Content-Digest if it exists

   *  Workload-Identity-Token

   For both requests and responses, the following signature parameters
   MUST be included:

   *  created

   *  expires - expiration MUST be short, e.g. on the order of minutes.
      The WIMSE architecture will provide separate mechanisms in support
      of long-lived compute processes.

   *  nonce

   *  tag - the value for implementations of this specification is
      wimse-service-to-service

   Since the signing key is sent along with the message, the keyid
   parameter SHOULD NOT be used.

   It is RECOMMENDED to include only one signature with the HTTP
   message.  If multiple ones are included, then the signature label
   included in both the Signature-Input and Signature headers SHOULD be
   wimse.

   A sender MUST ensure that each nonce it generates is unique, at least
   among messages sent to the same recipient.  To detect message
   replays, a recipient MAY reject a message (request or response) if a
   nonce is repeated.

   To promote interoperability, the ecdsa-p256-sha256 signing algorithm
   MUST be implemented by general purpose implementations of this spec.

   OPEN ISSUE: do we use the Accept-Signature field to signal that the
   response must be signed?

   Following is a non-normative example of a signed request and a signed
   response, using the keys mentioned in Section TBD.

   GET /gimme-ice-cream?flavor=vanilla HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Signature: wimse=:K4dfGnguF5f1L4DKBSp5XeFXosLGj8Y9fiUX06rL/wdOF+x3zTWmsvKWiY0B1oFZaOtm2FHru+YLjdkqa2WfCQ==:
   Signature-Input: wimse=("@method" "@request-target" "workload-identity-token");created=1718291357;expires=1718291657;nonce="abcd1111";tag="wimse-service-to-service"
   Workload-Identity-Token: aGVhZGVyCg.VGhpcyBpcyBub3QgYSByZWFsIHRva2VuLgo.c2lnbmF0dXJlCg

   Assuming that the workload being called has the following keypair:

   {
    "kty":"OKP",
    "crv":"Ed25519",
    "x":"CfaY1XX-aHJpenRP8ATm3yGlbcKA_treqOfwKrilwyg",
    "d":"fycSKS-iHZ6TC1BNwN6cE0sOBP3-4KgR-eqxNpnyhws"
   }

   A signed response would be:

   HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
   Connection: close
   Content-Digest: sha-256=:47DEQpj8HBSa+/TImW+5JCeuQeRkm5NMpJWZG3hSuFU=:
   Content-Type: text/plain
   Signature: wimse=:NMrMn3xhI6m9PI8mKVfpnH5qFGcEfuFxiCmsB5PJhGjUHT/5J4612EZwRw3V4kU4gGJmO+ER8RC4DM2HKVOYDQ==:
   Signature-Input: wimse=("@status" "workload-identity-token" "content-type" "content-digest" "@method";req "@request-target";req);created=1718295368;expires=1718295670;nonce="abcd2222";tag="wimse-service-to-service"
   Workload-Identity-Token: aGVhZGVyCg.VGhpcyBhaW4ndCBvbmUsIHRvby4K.c2lnbmF0dXJlCg

   No ice cream today.

4.  Using Mutual TLS for Service To Service Authentication

5.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security and Privacy

   TLS trust assumptions, server vs mutual auth, middleboxes

6.  IANA Considerations

   TODO IANA

   TODO: maybe a URI Scheme registration of wimse in URI schemes
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtml) per
   [RFC7595] but it's only being used in an example right now and might
   not even be appropriate.  Or maybe use an ietf URI scheme a la URN
   Namespace for IETF Use (https://www.iana.org/assignments/params/
   params.xhtml) somehow.  Or maybe nothing.  Or maybe something else.

6.1.  Media Type Registration

   TODO: application/wimse-id+jwt or appropriately bikeshedded media
   type name (despite my ongoing unease with using media types for
   typing JWTs) in Media Types (https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-
   types/media-types.xhtml).

   TODO: application/wimse-proof+jwt ...

6.2.  Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Field Name Registration

   TODO: Workload-Identity-Token from Section 3.1.1
