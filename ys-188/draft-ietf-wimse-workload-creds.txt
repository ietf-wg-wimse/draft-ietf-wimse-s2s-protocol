                       WIMSE Workload Credentials
                 draft-ietf-wimse-workload-creds-latest

Abstract

   The WIMSE architecture defines authentication and authorization for
   software workloads in a variety of runtime environments, from the
   most basic ones up to complex multi-service, multi-cloud, multi-
   tenant deployments.

   This document defines the credentials that workloads use to represent
   their identity.  They can be used in various protocols to
   authenticate workloads to each other.  To use these credentials,
   workloads must provide proof of possession of the associated private
   key material, which is covered in other documents.  This document
   focuses on the credentials alone, independent of the proof-of-
   possession mechanism.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines authentication and authorization in the context
   of interaction between two workloads.  This is the core component of
   the WIMSE architecture [I-D.ietf-wimse-arch].  This document focuses
   on the credentials that carry workload identity and bind the key
   material to the identity.  The presentation of the proof of
   possession of the key material is part of other documents and out of
   scope for this one.

   In this document, two credentials are defined:

   *  The Workload Identity Token (WIT) is a JWT that represents the
      identity of a workload and binds a public key to that identity.

   *  The Workload Identity Certificate (WIC) is an X.509 certificate
      that represents the identity of a workload and binds a public key
      to that identity.

   The Workload Identity Token is targeted for application-level
   protocols.  The Workload Identity Certificate is targeted for
   transport-level protocols.  This does not preclude the use of the WIT
   in transport-level protocols or the WIC in application-level
   protocols, but these are the primary intended uses.

   The various protocol bindings that use these credentials to
   authenticate workloads to each other are out of scope for this
   document.  At the time of writing, three such protocols are defined:

   *  Transport level authentication mutual TLS using the Workload
      Identity Certificate.

   *  Application level authentication using the Workload Identity Token
      in conjunction with a JWT-based proof of possession, the Workload
      Proof Token (WPT).

   *  Application level authentication using the Workload Identity Token
      in conjunction with HTTP Message Signatures.

1.1.  Use In Other Protocols

   The credentials defined in this document are designed to be used in
   various protocols.  This document does not define the protocols
   themselves, but rather the credentials that can be used within them.
   Additional protocols MAY be defined in the future that use these
   credentials for workload authentication.

1.2.  Deployment Architecture and Message Flow

   Independent of the transport between the workloads, we assume the
   following logical architecture (numbers refer to the sequence of
   steps listed below):

   +------------+               +------------+
   |            |      (2)      |            |
   |            |<=============>|            |
   |            |               |            |
   | Workload A |      (3)      | Workload B |
   |            |==============>|            |
   |            |               |            |
   |            |      (5)      |   +--------+
   |            |<==============|   |  PEP   |

     (1) | +----------------------+     | (4)
         | |                            |
         v v                            v
   +------------+               +------------+
   |            |               |            |
   |  Identity  |               |    PDP     |
   |   Server   |               | (optional) |
   |            |               |            |
   +------------+               +------------+

                      Figure 1: Sequence of Operations

   The Identity Server provisions credentials to each of the workloads.
   At least Workload A (and possibly both) must be provisioned with a
   credential before the call can proceed.  Details of communication
   with the Identity Server are out of scope of this document, however
   we do describe the credential received by the workload.

   PEP is a Policy Enforcement Point, the component that allows the
   message to go through or blocks it.  PDP is an optional Policy
   Decision Point, which may be deployed in architectures where policy
   management is centralized.  All details of policy management and
   message authorization are out of scope of this document.

   The high-level message flow is as follows:

   1.  Workload A (and similarly, Workload B) obtains a credential from
       the Identity Server.  This happens periodically, e.g. once every
       24 hours.

   2.  A transport connection is set up.  This may already include the
       use of the Workload Identity Certificate with transport-level
       security, such as TLS.

   3.  Workload A prepares to call Workload B.  This may include adding
       application-level authentication information, such as the
       Workload Identity Token and proof of possession.  Workload B
       authenticates Workload A.

   4.  Workload B authorizes the call.  This policy enforcement (Policy
       Enforcement Point, PEP) may include consulting with an external
       server (Policy Decision Point, PDP) when making this decision.

   5.  Workload B returns a response to Workload A, which may be an
       error response or a regular one.

   Depending on the protocol, the workload authentication may happen
   during step (2) at the transport-level or at step (3) at the
   application-level, or both.

1.3.  Workload Identifiers and Authentication Granularity

   The specific format of workload identifiers (see
   [I-D.ietf-wimse-arch]) is set by local policy for each deployment,
   and this choice has several implications.

   Prior to WIMSE, many use cases did not allow for fully granular
   authentication in containerized runtime platforms.  For instance,
   with mutual TLS, there's often no clear way to map the request's
   external access reference (e.g., Kubernetes Ingress path, service
   name, or host header) to the SubjectAltName value in the server
   certificate.  This means that the client could only verify if the
   server certificate is valid within a trust domain, not if it's tied
   to a specific workload.

   To enable mutual and granular authentication between workloads, two
   things must be in place:

   *  Each workload must know its own identifier.

   *  There needs to be an explicit mapping from the external handle
      used to access a workload (such as an Ingress path or service DNS
      name) to its workload identifier.

   Once these conditions are met, the methods described in this document
   can be used for the caller and callee to mutually authenticate.

   Implementations MUST allow for defining this mapping between the
   workload's access path and the workload identifier (e.g., through
   callback functions).  Deployments SHOULD use these features to
   establish a consistent set of identifiers within their environment.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   All terminology in this document follows [I-D.ietf-wimse-arch].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Application Level Workload-to-Workload Authentication

   As noted in the Introduction, for many deployments communication
   between workloads cannot use end-to-end transport security such as
   TLS.  For these deployment styles, this document proposes a
   credential that can be used at the application level.

3.1.  The Workload Identity Token

   The Workload Identity Token (WIT) is a JWS [RFC7515] signed JWT
   [RFC7519] that represents the identity of a workload.  It is issued
   by the Identity Server and binds a public key to the workload
   identity.  See Section 6.3 for security considerations.

   A WIT MUST contain the following content, except where noted:

   *  in the JOSE header:

      -  alg: An identifier for a JWS asymmetric digital signature
         algorithm (registered algorithm identifiers are listed in the
         IANA JOSE Algorithms registry [IANA.JOSE.ALGS]).  The value
         none MUST NOT be used.

      -  typ: the WIT is explicitly typed, as recommended in
         Section 3.11 of [RFC8725], using the wit+jwt media type.

   *  in the JWT claims:

      -  iss: The issuer of the token, which is the Identity Server,
         represented by a URI.  The iss claim is RECOMMENDED but
         optional, see Section 3.1.3 for more.

      -  sub: The subject of the token, which is the identity of the
         workload, represented by a URI.  See [I-D.ietf-wimse-arch] for
         details of the Workload Identifier.  And see Section 1.3 for
         security implications of these identifiers.

      -  exp: The expiration time of the token (as defined in
         Section 4.1.4 of [RFC7519]).  WITs should be refreshed
         regularly, e.g. on the order of hours.

      -  jti: A unique identifier for the token.  This claim is
         OPTIONAL.  The jti claim is frequently useful for auditing
         issuance of individual WITs or to revoke them, but some token
         generation environments do not support it.

      -  cnf: A confirmation claim referencing the public key of the
         workload.

         o  jwk: Within the cnf claim, a jwk key MUST be present that
            contains the public key of the workload as defined in
            Section 3.2 of [RFC7800].  The workload MUST prove
            possession of the corresponding private key when presenting
            the WIT to another party.  As such, it MUST NOT be used as a
            bearer token and is not intended for use in the
            Authorization header.

            +  alg: Within the jwk object, an alg field MUST be present.
               Allowed values are listed in the IANA "JSON Web Signature
               and Encryption Algorithms" registry established by
               [RFC7518].  The presented proof MUST be produced with the
               algorithm specified in this field.  The value none MUST
               NOT be used.  Algorithms used in combination with
               symmetric keys MUST NOT be used.  Also encryption
               algorithms MUST NOT be used as this would require
               additional key distribution outside of the WIT.  To
               promote interoperability, the ES256 signing algorithm
               MUST be supported by general purpose implementations of
               this document.

   As noted in [I-D.ietf-wimse-arch], a workload identifier is a URI
   with a trust domain component.  The runtime environment often
   determines which URI scheme is used, e.g. if SPIFFE is used to
   authenticate workloads, it mandates "spiffe" URIs.  However for those
   deployments where this is not the case, this document (Section 7.3)
   defines the "wimse" URI scheme which can be used by any deployment
   that implements this protocol.

   An example WIT might look like this:

             Figure 2: An example Workload Identity Token (WIT)

   The decoded JOSE header of the WIT from the example above is shown
   here:

   {
     "alg": "ES256",
     "kid": "June 5",
     "typ": "wit+jwt"
   }

                     Figure 3: Example WIT JOSE Header

   The decoded JWT claims of the WIT from the example above are shown
   here:

   {
     "cnf": {
       "jwk": {
         "alg": "EdDSA",
         "crv": "Ed25519",
         "kty": "OKP",
         "x": "1CXXvflN_LVVsIsYXsUvB03JmlGWeCHqQVuouCF92bg"
       }
     },

     "sub": "wimse://example.com/specific-workload"
   }

                        Figure 4: Example WIT Claims

   The claims indicate that the example WIT:

   *  is valid until Thu Apr 24 2025 16:35:10 GMT (represented as
      NumericDate Section 2 of [RFC7519] value 1745512510).

   *  identifies the workload to which the token was issued as
      wimse://example.com/specific-workload.

   *  has a unique identifier of x-_1CTL2cca3CSE4cwb_l.

   *  binds the public key represented by the jwk confirmation method to
      the workload wimse://example.com/specific-workload.

   *  requires the proof to be produced with the EdDSA signature
      algorithm.

   For elucidative purposes only, the workload's key, including the
   private part, is shown below in JWK [RFC7517] format:

   {
    "kty": "OKP",
    "crv": "Ed25519",
    "x": "1CXXvflN_LVVsIsYXsUvB03JmlGWeCHqQVuouCF92bg",
    "d": "sdLX8yCYKqo_XvGBLn-ZWeKT7llYeeQpgeCaXVxb5kY"
   }

                      Figure 5: Example Workload's Key

   The afore-exampled WIT is signed with the private key of the Identity
   Server.  The public key(s) of the Identity Server need to be known to
   all workloads in order to verify the signature of the WIT.  The
   Identity Server's public key from this example is shown below in JWK
   [RFC7517] format:

   {
    "kty": "EC",
    "kid": "June 5",
    "crv": "P-256",

    "y": "n__VndPMR021-59UAs0b9qDTFT-EZtT6xSNs_xFskLo"
   }

3.1.1.  The WIT HTTP Header

   A WIT is conveyed in an HTTP header field named Workload-Identity-
   Token.

   ABNF [RFC5234] for the value of Workload-Identity-Token header field
   is provided in Figure 7:

   ALPHA = %x41-5A / %x61-7A ; A-Z / a-z
   DIGIT = %x30-39 ; 0-9
   base64url = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_")
   JWT =  base64url "." base64url "." base64url
   WIT =  JWT

            Figure 7: Workload-Identity-Token Header Field ABNF

   The following shows the WIT from Figure 2 in an example of a
   Workload-Identity-Token header field:

       Figure 8: An example Workload Identity Token HTTP Header Field

   Note that per [RFC9110], header field names are case insensitive;
   thus, Workload-Identity-Token, workload-identity-token, WORKLOAD-
   IDENTITY-TOKEN, etc., are all valid and equivalent header field
   names.  However, case is significant in the header field value.

3.1.2.  Including Additional Claims

   The WIT contains JSON structures and therefore can be trivially
   extended by adding more claims beyond those defined in the current
   specification.  This, however, could result in interoperability
   issues, which the following rules are addressing.

   *  To ensure interoperability in WIMSE environments, the use of
      Private claim names (Sec. 4.3 of [RFC7519]) is NOT RECOMMENDED.

   *  In closed environments, deployers MAY freely add claims to the
      WIT.  Such claims SHOULD be collision-resistant, such as
      example.com/myclaim.

   *  A recipient that does not understand such claims MUST ignore them,
      as per Sec. 4 of [RFC7519].

   *  Outside of closed environments, new claims MUST be registered with
      IANA [IANA.JWT.CLAIMS] before they can be used.

3.1.3.  A note on iss claim and key distribution

   It is RECOMMENDED that the WIT carries an iss claim.  This
   specification itself does not make use of a potential iss claim but
   also carries the trust domain in the workload identifier (see
   [I-D.ietf-wimse-arch] for a definition of the identifier and related
   rules).  Implementations MAY include the iss claim in the form of a
   https URL to facilitate key distribution via mechanisms like the
   jwks_uri from [RFC8414] but alternative key distribution methods may
   make use of the trust domain included in the workload identifier
   which is carried in the mandatory sub claim.

3.2.  Error Conditions

   Errors may occur during the processing of the WIT.  If the WIT
   validation fails for any reason, such as an invalid signature, an
   expired validity time window, or a malformed data structure, an error
   is returned.  Typically, this will be in response to an API call, so
   an HTTP status code such as 400 (Bad Request) is appropriate.  This
   response could include more details as per [RFC9457], such as an
   indicator that the wrong key material or algorithm was used.  The use
   of HTTP status code 401 is NOT RECOMMENDED for this purpose because
   it requires a WWW-Authenticate with acceptable http auth mechanisms
   in the error response and an associated Authorization header in the
   subsequent request.  The use of these headers for the WIT is not
   compatible with this specification.

3.3.  Coexistence with JWT Bearer Tokens

   The WIT defines new HTTP headers.  It can therefore be presented
   along with existing headers used for JWT bearer tokens.  This
   property allows for transition from mechanisms using identity tokens
   based on bearer JWTs to proof of possession based WITs.  A workload
   may implement a policy that accepts both bearer tokens and WITs
   during a transition period.  This policy may be configurable per-
   caller to allow the workload to reject bearer tokens from callers
   that support WITs.  Once a deployment fully supports WITs, then the
   use of bearer tokens for identity can be disabled through policy.
   Implementations should be careful when implementing such a transition
   strategy, since the decision which token to prefer is made when the
   caller's identity has still not been authenticated, and needs to be
   revalidated following the authentication step.

   The WIT can also coexist with tokens used to establish security
   context, such as transaction tokens
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-transaction-tokens].  In this case a workload's
   authorization policy may take into account both the sending
   workload's identity and the information in the context token.  For
   example, the identity in the WIT may be used to establish which API
   calls can be made and information in the context token may be used to
   determine which specific resources can be accessed.

4.  Transport Level Workload-to-Workload Authentication

   As noted in the introduction, for many deployments, transport-level
   protection of application traffic is ideal.

4.1.  The Workload Identity Certificate

   The Workload Identity Certificate is an X.509 certificate.  The
   workload identity MUST be encoded in a SubjectAltName extension of
   type URI.  There MUST be only one SubjectAltName extension of type
   URI in a Workload Identity Certificate.  If the workload will act as
   a TLS server for clients that do not understand workload identities
   it is RECOMMENDED that the Workload Identity Certificate contain a
   SubjectAltName of type DNSName with the appropriate DNS names for the
   server.  The certificate MAY contain SubjectAltName extensions of
   other types.

4.2.  Client Authorization Using the Workload Identity

   The server application retrieves the workload identifier from the
   client certificate subjectAltName.  The identifier is used in
   authorization, accounting and auditing.  For example, the full
   workload identifier may be matched against ACLs to authorize actions
   requested by the peer and the identifier may be included in log
   messages to associate actions to the client workload for audit
   purposes.  A deployment may specify other authorization policies
   based on the specific details of how the workload identifier is
   constructed.  The path portion of the workload identifier MUST always
   be considered in the scope of the trust domain.  See Section 1.3 on
   additional security implications of workload identifiers.

5.  Implementation Status


   // Note to RFC Editor: please remove this section, as well as the
   // reference to RFC 7942, before publication.  This section records
   the status of known implementations of the protocol defined by this
   specification at the time of posting of this Internet-Draft, and is
   based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].  The description of
   implementations in this section is intended to assist the IETF in its
   decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs.  Please note that
   the listing of any individual implementation here does not imply
   endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort has been spent to
   verify the information presented here that was supplied by IETF
   contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not be construed to
   be, a catalog of available implementations or their features.
   Readers are advised to note that other implementations may exist.

   According to RFC 7942, "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  Workload Identity

   The Workload Identifier is scoped within an issuer and therefore any
   sub-components (path portion of Identifier) are only unique within a
   trust domain defined by the issuer.  Using a Workload Identifier
   without taking into account the trust domain could allow one domain
   to issue tokens to spoof identities in another domain.  Additionally,
   the trust domain must be tied to an authorized issuer cryptographic
   trust anchor through some mechanism such as a JWKS or X.509
   certificate chain.  The association of an issuer, trust domain and a
   cryptographic trust anchor MUST be communicated securely out of band.

6.2.  Workload Identity Token and Proof of Possession

   The Workload Identity Token (WIT) is bound to a secret cryptographic
   key and is always presented with a proof of possession as described
   in Section 3.1.  The WIT is a general purpose token that can be
   presented in multiple contexts.  The WIT and its PoP are only used in
   the application-level options, and both are not used in MTLS.  The
   WIT MUST NOT be used as a bearer token.  While this helps reduce the
   sensitivity of the token it is still possible that a token and its
   proof of possession may be captured and replayed within the PoP's
   lifetime.  The following are some mitigations for the capture and
   reuse of the proof of possession (PoP):

   *  Preventing Eavesdropping and Interception with TLS

   An attacker observing or intercepting the communication channel can
   view the token and its proof of possession and attempt to replay it
   to gain an advantage.  In order to prevent this the token and proof
   of possession MUST be sent over a secure, server authenticated TLS
   connection unless a secure channel is provided by some other
   mechanisms.

   *  Limiting Proof of Possession Lifespan

   The proof of possession MUST be time limited.  A PoP should only be
   valid over the time necessary for it to be successfully used for the
   purpose it is needed.  This will typically be on the order of
   minutes.  PoPs received outside their validity time MUST be rejected.

   *  Limiting Proof of Possession Scope

   In order to reduce the risk of theft and replay the PoP should have a
   limited scope.  For example, a PoP may be targeted for use with a
   specific workload and even a specific transaction to reduce the
   impact of a stolen PoP.  In some cases a workload may wish to reuse a
   PoP for a period of time or have it accepted by multiple target
   workloads.  A careful analysis is warranted to understand the impacts
   to the system if a PoP is disclosed allowing it to be presented by an
   attacker along with a captured WIT.

   *  Replay Protection

   Proof of possession mechanisms should include replay protection to
   prevent reuse of a captured PoP.  Without it an attacker can replay a
   captured PoP within its validity period.

   *  Binding to TLS Endpoint

   The POP MAY be bound to a transport layer sender such as the client
   identity of a TLS session or TLS channel binding parameters.  The
   mechanisms for binding are outside the scope of this specification.

6.3.  Workload Identity Key Management

   Both the Workload Identity Token and the Workload Identity
   Certificate carry a public key.  The corresponding private key:

   *  MUST be kept private

   *  MUST be individual for each Workload Identifier (see
      [I-D.ietf-wimse-arch])

   *  MUST NOT be used once the credential is expired

   *  SHOULD be re-generated for each new Workload Identity Token or
      Certificate.

6.4.  Middle Boxes

   In some deployments the Workload Identity Token and proof of
   possession may pass through multiple systems.  The communication
   between the systems is over TLS, but the token and PoP are available
   in the clear at each intermediary.  While the intermediary cannot
   modify the token or the information within the PoP they can attempt
   to capture and replay the token or modify the data not protected by
   the PoP.

   Mitigations listed in Section 3 can be used to provide some
   protection from middle boxes.

   Deployments should perform analysis on their situation to determine
   if it is appropriate to trust and allow traffic to pass through a
   middle box.

6.5.  Privacy Considerations

   WITs and the proofs of possession may contain private information
   such as user names or other identities.  Care should be taken to
   prevent the disclosure of this information.  The use of TLS helps
   protect the privacy of WITs and proofs of possession.

   WITs and certificates with workload identifiers are typically
   associated with a workload and not a specific user, however in some
   deployments the workload may be associated directly to a user.  While
   these are exceptional cases a deployment should evaluate if the
   disclosure of WITs or certificates can be used to track a user.
