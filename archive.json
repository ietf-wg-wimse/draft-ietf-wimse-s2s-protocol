When it was explained that there wasn't really an appropriate SF type to carry a JWT (and especially that sf-binary didn't fit at all) the grumbling shifted to general complaints that the syntax wasn't well defined (despite, as you point out, the syntax of a JWT being completely defined by JWT). The grumbling was partially mollified by the addition of some less than useful ABNF (found [here](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9449.html#section-4.1-6)). It was more involved than that, of course, but that's the basic story line. So I thought I'd try and get ahead of that kind of DE push-back a bit while adding some ABNF that's a little more descriptive/useful. Which is what is [here](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-sheffer-wimse-s2s-protocol-00.html#name-workload-identity-token-hea).

Validating that this issuer is authorized to issue Wimse credentials would require additional steps.  \r\n\r\nOne possible additional step is to maintain a configuration that maps a trust domain present in a WIMSE identifier to a particular trust root.  This could be done by either using the trust domain portion of the WIMSE identifier to select the CA trust root that is used for path validation or to go through path validation with an existing trust to and verify the trust domain maps to the root certificate used to validate the credential after the fact.   We could also define a discovery mechanism to discover this configuration, perhaps through a well know URI path or through DNS (both would have some difficult security considerations.  \r\n\r\nIf you already have trust established with a particular trust anchor for authorizing WIMSE then you could possibly use certificate fields to authorize the issuer.  Theoretically, naming constraints to could used to constrain a particular sub-CA to only issue credentials for a particular trust domain.  One could also define other extensions or extended key usages that could relate to WIMSE, but that would need to be defined.  \r\n\r\nI think it would be best to start with a requirement for a configuration of trust domain to a CA.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I question whether this could be done securely, but I think we should have the discussion:\r\n1. Is there a sensible policy that would make this OK?  It seems that legacy application would be none the worse off, but application that could handle the WIT would still benefit.  I think there is a difficulty here in that you have client an services sides that might be updated a different times making it more complex.\r\n2. Perhaps there is an alternate form of POP that would be easier.  For example binding to a TLS key or identity.

To support this base case, Workload agents generate private key/public key pairs, construct CSRs, and request and receive X.509 Certificates, after passing through the Attestation steps described in the draft [WIMSE Architecture](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-wimse-arch/) document.  Workload agents also bootstrap and periodically update Trust Domains and their corresponding Trust Bundles.  \r\n\r\nOne option is to contact a central IdP for a centrally-signed WIT, with the proof-of-possession coming in the form of one of (Sec. 4.2 or 4.3); as is currently in the draft.  I filed this issue to consider supporting an additional use case: a self-signed WIT option.   \r\n\r\nFor the self-signed WIT option, the Workload agent can use the workload's private key and X.509 Certificate chain to construct a self-signed WIT.  The X.509 Certificate chain can be conveyed in the [x5c](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7515.html#section-4.1.6) token header of the WIT.  The Workload can establish mTLS communication with compatible destination Workloads, together with a self-signed WIT.  \r\n\r\nHere's a more detailed diagram:\r\n\r\n```mermaid\r\ngraph LR\r\nA(Identity Server)\r\nB(Workload Agent) -->|Workload API| A(Identity Server)\r\nA -->|x509 cred| B\r\nB -->|X509 cred| C(Source Workload)\r\nC(Source Workload) -->|mTLS & WIT| D(Proxy)\r\n    B -->|Generate WIT| B\r\n    B -->|WIT cred| C\r\n    D -->|Add x5t header| D\r\n    D -->|WIT & x5t| E(Destination Workload)\r\n    E -->|validate WIT & x5t| E\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen a Proxy is deployed between the source Workload and the destination Workload, mTLS is terminated at the Proxy. \r\nThe Proxy can terminate mTLS, and add an `x5t` header containing the fingerprint of the client's X.509 Certificate that was used in the mTLS handshake. The self-signed WIT could be forwarded by the Proxy intact in a request header, together with the `x5t` header.  The destination Workload can then validate the Source Workload's self-signed WIT and the `x5t` using the information provided in the request, together with the corresponding Trust Domain's Trust Bundles.\r\n\r\nI'm not arguing that Self-signed WIT should be the only way to go, just that it should be an option to implement.",

Allow the \"iss\" to be something other than the trust domain, document the implications of a delta and perhaps add some constraints that will allow the URL to be mapped back to the Trust Domain (e.g. how can I be sure that the URL is pointing to a trust bundle associated with the trust domain - perhaps the ability to verify a credentials using the retrieved key material is enough).

Well-established protocols exist for Workload-to-Workload communication over mutually authenticated TLS 1.3.\r\n\r\nI would like to propose an `Option 3: Transport-layer Proof-of-possession`, with a reference to the TLS credential used in the `cnf` claim of the WIT, based on https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8705#section-3.1.\r\n\r\n1. _In the section `The Workload Identity Token {#to-wit}`, change the description of `cnf` to the following:_\r\n\r\n* `cnf` : A confirmation claim containing either the public key of the workload OR a cryptographically strong hash of the X.509 certificate conveyed during Transport layer security. \r\n    * The public key `cnf` contains the jwk member as defined in {{Section 3.2 of RFC7800}}. The workload MUST prove possession of the corresponding private key when presenting the WIT to another party, which can be accomplished by using it in conjunction with one of the methods in {{dpop-esque-auth}} or {{http-sig-auth}}. As such, it MUST NOT be used as a bearer token and is not intended for use in the Authorization header.\r\n    * The X.509 certificate hash `cnf` contains the `x5t#S256` hash as described in [Section 3.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8705#section-3.1) of [[RFC8705](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8705)]. When this value is provided, Proof-of-possession is delegated to the Transport-layer. The receiving Workload MUST verify that the `x5t#S256` claim matches the hash of the Client's X.509 Certificate presented at the Transport-layer.\r\n\r\n2. _Add the following sub-section after `Option 2: Authentication Based on HTTP Message Signatures {#http-sig-auth}`:_\r\n\r\n### Option 3: Transport-layer Proof-of-possession\r\n\r\nIn the case where Workload-to-Workload communication is secured by Mutually-authenticated [Transport Layer Security 1.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446#section-2), Proof-of-possession is conveyed via each Workload's `CertificateVerify` message. In this case, the Transport-layer guarantees that each Workload has already validated its Peer's Proof-of-possession of the Private Key. Proof-of-possession is conveyed during the TLS 1.3 handshake protocol using each peer's `Certificate` and `CertificateVerify` messages, along with other protocol messages transmitted. The Transport-layer must cache the SHA-256 hash of the validated Client `Certificate` and the first Subject Alternative Name (SAN) URI entry for use at the Application-layer. When the Destination Workload receives a WIT at the Application-layer with `cnf` claim with `x5t#S256` property, it MUST establish Proof-of-possession as follows:\r\n* Validate that the Certificate-bound WIT's `cnf` claim's `x5t#S256` property matches the cached SHA-256 hash of the validated Client Certificate.\r\n* Validate that the WIT's `sub` claim matches the first Subject Alternative Name (SAN) URI entry.\r\n\r\nThe first step proves that the WIT was issued to the holder of the PrivateKey for the X.509 Certificate presented by the client, and that Private Key was used to establish the mTLS session over which the WIT was transmitted. The second step validates that both the X.509 Certificate and the WIT were issued to the same Workload.",

In the proxy->backend (second hop), the backend receives the WIT, but trusts that the proxy completed PoP validation.  The forwarded WIT may provide additional security context for the request.  \n\nThe client must be in the proxy's trust bundle map, but may be an externally-deployed workload and may also be in a different trust domain.

Like this you actually have end-to-end proof of possession and the backend doesn't need to trust the proxy to perform it.

The HTTP-sig approach may be too HTTP-specific.  IMO, referring to an X.509 certificate hash is much simpler and avoids the additional complexity for adoption.\n\nIf we consider the threat model with the Proxy as security SPOF, that has been compromised, I'm not sure the WPT helps much, unless it is sufficiently time-constrained to limit replays.  A reasonably high-percentage of sensitive workload-to-workload traffic is likely to travel through a compromised Proxy even over a short period of time.  HTTP sig is probably a better option there since it has some replay protections, as noted in the [comparisons](https://github.com/ietf-wg-wimse/draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol/blob/main/draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol.md#comparing-the-dpop-inspired-option-with-message-signatures-app-level-comparison), but is as discussed an HTTP-only solution.\n\nI acknowledge there are tradeoffs, including in my proposal the limitations in open standards for secure client_cert_hash forwarding.

As you said, additional claims can be added to the WPT (although there was talk at one point about discouraging or prohibiting it). But I think interoperability would be achieved from saying what the claim(s) are and what behavior or processing is expected/required.

A particular architecture could trust certain WPT issuers (likely something like gateway nodes) as transaction token issuers too and not need a 3rd party call out.

It states \"This option uses the WIMSE Identity Token to sign the request and optionally, the response\".\n\nIt's not using the WIT (Workload Identity Token) to sign messages, it's using the key pair that the workload possesses which is also used for signing the WPT in the dPoP-inspired option 1.\n\nPartly I think the confusing arise because the key pair which the workload is supposed to use for \"Application Level Workload To Workload Authentication\" is not given a name or term, or clearly defined. This concept of the workload-owned key pair should be better defined and expanded upon.",

For instance, with mutual TLS, there's often no clear way to map the request's external access reference (e.g., Kubernetes Ingress path, service name, or host header) to the SubjectAltName value in the server certificate. This means that the client could only verify if the server certificate is valid within a trust domain, not if it's tied to a specific workload.\n\nTo enable mutual and granular authentication between workloads, two things must be in place:\n- Each workload must know its own identifier.\n- There needs to be an explicit mapping from the external handle used to access a workload (such as an Ingress path or service DNS name) to its workload identifier.\n</quote>\n\nThe above text suggests that the workload identifier is for a specific instance, however either should be possible (with the most common use case expected to be a \"service\" rather than an \"instance\").

The question is whether the issuer of the Workload Identity Token MUST be the same as the trust domain indicated in the workload identifier. Section 3.1.3 seems to suggest so: \n\n>[3.1.3. ](https://ietf-wg-wimse.github.io/draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol/draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol.html#section-3.1.3)[A note on iss claim and key distribution](https://ietf-wg-wimse.github.io/draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol/draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol.html#name-a-note-on-iss-claim-and-key)\nIt is RECOMMENDED that the WIT carries an iss claim. This specification itself does not make use of a potential iss claim but also carries the trust domain in the workload identifier (see [[I-D.ietf-wimse-arch](https://ietf-wg-wimse.github.io/draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol/draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol.html#I-D.ietf-wimse-arch)] for a definition of the identifier and related rules). Implementations MAY include the iss claim in the form of a https URL to facilitate key distribution via mechanisms like the jwks_uri from [[RFC8414](https://ietf-wg-wimse.github.io/draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol/draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol.html#RFC8414)] but alternative key distribution methods may make use of the trust domain included in the workload identifier which is carried in the mandatory sub claim.\n\nHowever, it's not obvious to me that the notion of a trust domain as currently defined is the same as an issuer (nor should it be I believe).

After reading the spec a few times, I inferred that the intention of the authors was that the WPT should be bound with even further granularity (e.g `aud: https://example.com/v1/foo` rather than just `aud: https://example.com`) which reduces the extent to which a stolen WPT could be reused or redirect to complete a different action than originally intended. \n\nThis in general seems like a good/positive thing - but - I think could be stated more explicitly within the spec.

An explicit point to note the difference between these values could ensure implementations do not incorrectly assume these are equivalent,\n\n* It appears that `keyid` was denoted a required signature parameter in earlier drafts of the HTTP Message Signatures document, with this requirement relaxed in the published RFC. While implementations should obviously conform to the RFC, this does present a scenario where older implementations of HTTP Message Signatures might expect a `keyid` (for example, Python\u2019s http-message-signatures https://pypi.org/project/http-message-signatures/).\n\n@jsnctl\n",

For example, a PoP may be targeted for use with a specific workload and even a specific transaction to reduce the impact of a stolen PoP. In some cases a workload may wish to reuse a PoP for a period of time or have it accepted by multiple target workloads. A careful analysis is warranted to understand the impacts to the system if a PoP is disclosed allowing it to be presented by an attacker along with a captured WIT.\r\n\r\n* Binding to a Timestamp or Nonce\r\n\r\nA proof of possession should include information that can be used to uniquely identify it such as a unique timestamp or nonce.  This can be used by the receiver to perform basic replay protection against tokens it has already seen. Depending upon the design of the system it may be difficult to synchronize the replay cache across all token validators. In this case, if the PoP is not sufficiently scoped it may be usable with another workload.\r\nWhile a fresh nonce could be included in the PoP, a mechanism for distributing a fresh challenge nonce from the validator to provide single use properties of a PoP is outside the scope of this specification.\r\n```",

Oh, here's the text from RFC 9421 again (@bc-pi will love it, I'm sure):\r\n\r\n> Unless overridden by additional parameters and rules, HTTP field values MUST be combined into a single value as defined in [Section 5.2](https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-5.2) of [[HTTP](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9421.html#RFC9110)] to create the component value. Specifically, HTTP fields sent as multiple fields MUST be combined by concatenating the values using a single comma and a single space as a separator (\",\" + \" \"). Note that intermediaries are allowed to combine values of HTTP fields with any amount of whitespace between the commas, and if this behavior is not accounted for by the verifier, the signature can fail, since the signer and verifier will see a different component value in their respective signature bases. For robustness, it is RECOMMENDED that signed messages include only a single instance of any field covered under the signature, particularly with the value for any list-based fields serialized using the algorithm below. This approach increases the chances of the field value remaining untouched through intermediaries. Where that approach is not possible and multiple instances of a field need to be sent separately, it is RECOMMENDED that signers and verifiers process any list-based fields taking all individual field values and combining them based on the strict algorithm below, to counter possible intermediary behavior.",

It's a signed token that incorporates workload-specific information (mainly the workload's ID and its public key, but potentially future extensions) and therefore it should normally only be shared between a workload and its immediate neighbors (its successors on the call chain). \r\n\r\nI understood the WIT to be a Workload Identity Token.  I agree it should contain the identity of the workload, represented by a URI, in the \"sub\" claim.  When it comes to proof-of-possession semantics under [RFC 7800, Section 3.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7800#section-3.1), I think the \"cnf\" claim should be used to identify the proof-of-possession key.  \r\n\r\nIn this context, I think that referencing an X.509 Certificate (that contains the Workload's public key) using \"x5t#S256\" should be an option for \"cnf\", as an alternative to inlining the public key in the \"jwk\" member.\r\n\r\n| As such, there are two options:\r\n| \r\n| The next hop is protected with MTLS (implicitly, there is no middlebox to break TLS security): no need for WIT because the identity information and public key are provided in the certificate.\r\n| The next hop is not protected with MTLS but rather with server-authenticated TLS (and potentially a middlebox): we send the WIT over the network hop, and bind it to a signature or proof-of-possession.\r\n\r\nI think from this description you would classify a proxy as a middlebox.  I think the middlebox proxy may be capable of hop-to-hop mTLS.  In this case, we would have the additional option:\r\n\r\n* next hop is protected with mTLS, and is a middlebox.  The middlebox is a proxy that forwards requests to destination workloads over mTLS.\r\n\r\nIn this architecture, the middlebox must perform proof-of-possession verification of the Workload's private key.  The `Workload-Identity-Token` header can be forwarded intact to the destination Workload.  The destination Workload verifies the identity of the middlebox over mTLS.   \r\n\r\n| By the way, the WIT is \"authenticated\" - it is signed by a trusted party, the server that issued it.\r\n\r\nAgree, I think I wasn't clear in my wording.  You're correct, the WIT is signed by the issuer.  I probably should have said something like:\r\n\r\nI think the Identity Server should issue WITs with a confirmation claim indicating the Workload's public key.  I think recipients of the WIT should require proof-of-possession of the Workload's private key, according to the information in the \"cnf\" claim.  I think the document should support verifying the proof-of-possession of the Workload's private key via one of \r\n1. WPT, as described in [1] Section 4.2.\r\n2. HTTP Message signatures, as described in [1] Section 4.3.\r\n3. mTLS, as described in [3].\r\n\r\nWhen the Identity Server puts an \"x5t#S256\" value in the \"cnf\" claim, the proof-of-posession verification method follows the semantics of [RFC 8705, Section 3.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8705#name-jwt-certificate-thumbprint-).\r\n\r\n[1] https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol/01/\r\n[2] https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/121/materials/minutes-121-wimse-01\r\n[3] https://github.com/ietf-wg-wimse/draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol/pull/76 \r\n",

If the client did not perform standard host name validation then the WIMSE client SHOULD further use the WIMSE workload identifier to validate the server.

      "body": "This PR fixes the hyphenation of compound modifiers in the document title and section headings. According to standard English grammar rules, compound modifiers that precede a noun should be hyphenated for clarity.\n\n## Changes Made\n\nThe following instances were updated from \"Workload to Workload\" to \"Workload-to-Workload\":\n\n1. **Document title**: `\"WIMSE Workload to Workload Authentication\"` \u2192 `\"WIMSE Workload-to-Workload Authentication\"`\n2. **Document abbreviation**: `\"WIMSE Workload to Workload\"` \u2192 `\"WIMSE Workload-to-Workload\"`\n3. **Section heading**: `\"Application Level Workload To Workload Authentication\"` \u2192 `\"Application Level Workload-to-Workload Authentication\"`\n4. **Section heading**: `\"Using Mutual TLS for Workload To Workload Authentication\"` \u2192 `\"Using Mutual TLS for Workload-to-Workload Authentication\"`\n\n## Rationale\n\nIn phrases like \"Workload-to-Workload Authentication\", the term \"Workload-to-Workload\" functions as a compound modifier describing the type of authentication. Following standard grammar conventions, compound modifiers should be hyphenated to avoid ambiguity and improve readability.\n\nThe document already uses correct hyphenation in other contexts (e.g., \"workload-to-workload call\", \"workload-to-workload protocol\"), so this change ensures consistency throughout.\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Minimal change**: Only 4 lines modified\n- **No functional impact**: Changes are purely editorial/grammatical\n- **Improved clarity**: Better follows technical writing standards\n- **Consistency**: Aligns with existing hyphenated usage in the document\n\nFixes #142.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n>\n> <details>\n> <summary>Firewall rules blocked me from connecting to one or more addresses</summary>\n>\n> #### I tried to connect to the following addresses, but was blocked by firewall rules:\n>\n> - `https://api.github.com/repos/ietf-wg-wimse/draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol`\n>   - Triggering command: `python3 lib/default-branch.py ietf-wg-wimse draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol` (http block)\n>\n> If you need me to access, download, or install something from one of these locations, you can either:\n>\n> - Configure [Actions setup steps](https://gh.io/copilot/actions-setup-steps) to set up my environment, which run before the firewall is enabled\n> - Add the appropriate URLs or hosts to my [firewall allow list](https://gh.io/copilot/firewall-config)\n>\n> </details>\n\n\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n\ud83d\udcac Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

It is important to differentiate this from the server authentication at the transport-level which generally happens when the connection is established and crucially, before a request is sent. Relying on a WIT & POP in the response for server authentication means the request is sent before the peer is authenticated, potentially sending it to an undesired party. Mitigating measures may include using both transport-level and application-level workload authentication simultaneously. See TODO link from other PR.\n```",
